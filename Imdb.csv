But from their on the movie is predictable and rushed, with story lines that you have seen elsewhere and executed better elsewhere. It's predictablility wouldn't hurt if the story and most of its characters were compelling enough to allow the audience to be invested and care. As the third act of the movie began I quickly tried to rummage through the entire movie trying to justify watching the movie and I was left with only a few reasons. One of them was the world created.Standout character: Shrike, solid arc and amazing design. (You have seen this character in the trailer).;6 December 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571234/reviews?ref_=tt_sa_3;danielfnemes;Better than expected;7/10;"When I heard the name and concept of the movie (it's about big cities on wheels) I thought wtf, what a stupid idea and wasted talent and money on CGI. However I found the movie to be pretty entertaining.
The good parts:
as everyone else mentioned in their reviews: the visuals/CGI. Beautiful scenery and sets, vibrant colors, spectaculars battles, very good cinematographyvery dynamic. There is almost non stop action and anticipation. No bathroom time.strong performance of Hugo Weavingstrong performance of Stephen Lang and CGI team for Shrike characterNow, if you think of the movie as a modern fairy tale for children and teenagers than it is more than ok. If you expect more...
Well, here are the bad things:
the concept itself lacks any logic. After a world war destroys the advanced stage of evolution the humanity have reached, the remaining humans build huge mobile islands on land that move on tracks or wheels or legs to scavenge... something. While others build a great city defended by a wall.as others have mentioned, the movie tries to fit a lot of things from the books in two hours and it fails. The characters have no depth, no complexity and there is no real emotional attachment to themtoo much resemblance to Mad Maxthere are no big names involved except for Hugo Weaving and of course Peter Jackson as a writerthe plot is predictable, with holes and its main purpose is to justify the action and special effects. Annoying cliches both in characters, lines and story (the wise old Asian, the warrior girl, etc). Oh and yeah, SPOILER ALERT there is a genuine ""I am your father"" moment...However the movie manages to entertain. It is a pity it was a box office flop. Probably because of the concept itself which is hard to sell, the lack of efficient marketing, the bad critic reviews and mostly the lack of big names that would draw interest. Not to mention the competition with other movies launched in the same period such as Aquaman.Conclusion: you will not regret seeing the movie if you want to see a visually stunning modern fairy tale. But don't expect Lord of The Rings.";10 March 2019
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571234/reviews?ref_=tt_sa_3;bob-the-movie-man;At last, the hilarious Brexit comedy we've all been waiting for.;5/10;"As comedy goes it's classic gold! London has been transferred, presumably via a futuristic huge forklift truck of some kind, onto a huge chassis and is now chugging its way across mainland Europe. Needing fuel, it has the capability to gobble-up (take that Barnier!) other towns and cities (also roaming the countryside) which London 'digests' (smoke that Tusk!). Curiously, the captured cities' inhabitants are not exterminated but integrated into the City's population: so much for any anti-immigration policy! (LOL).But all doesn't go entirely smoothly for the UK capital. The Lord Mayor of London (Patrick Malahide) declares ""We should never have gone into Europe. It's the biggest mistake we ever made"". (Classic: how we SNORTED with laughter!)Stuffing it squarely to the 'remainers', London makes its own future. ""It's time to show the world how strong London can be"". Having conquered most of Europe, it's time to set its sights on new markets to conquer: so London takes the Chinese on! (Now the tears of laughter are flowing freely!) Trade deals have never been more entertaining since ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace""!OK, so in the interests of 'advertising standards', I'd better make clear before you rush out to the cinema expecting a comedy feature that my tongue is firmly in my cheek here. For ""Mortal Engines"" is the latest sci-fi feature from Peter Jackson. But when viewed from a Brexit perspective, it's hilarious!In terms of plot, this (like ""Waterworld"") makes clever use of the Universal logo to set the agenda. The world has been decimated with a worldwide war - though clearly one that selectively destroyed bits of London and not others! - and the survivors must try to survive in any way they can. Settlements are divided between those that are 'static' and those (like London) that are mobile and constantly evolving: ""Municipal Darwinism"" as it is hysterically described. But London, or rather the power-crazed Londoner Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving), wants revolution rather than evolution and he is working on development of one of the super-weapons that started the world's demise in the first place.But Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), separated when young from her mother Pandora (yes, she has a box and we've seen it: wink, wink) is intent on stopping him, since she is on a personal path of vengence. Teaming up with Londoner Tom (Robert Sheehan) and activist Anna Fang (Jihae) they must face both Thaddeus and the ever-relentless Shrike (Stephen Lang) to try to derail the destructive plan.Anna Fang declares ""I'm not subtle"" and neither is this movie. The film is loud and action-filled and (as a significant plus) visually extremely impressive with it. I'm not a great fan of excessive CGI but here it is essential, and the special-effects team do a great job. The production design is tremendous - a lot of money has been thrown at this - and the costume design inventive, a high-spot (again snortworthy) being the Beefeater guards costumes!Where the film really crashes, like a post-Brexit stock market, is with the dialogue. The screenplay by Jackson himself, with his regular writers Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens contains some absolute clunkers, notwithstanding the unintended LOL-worthy Brexit irony. It's jaw-droppingly bad, believe me.As for 'the turns', the only real ""name"" in the whole film is Jackson-favourite Hugo Weaving. Just about everyone else in the cast is pretty well unknown, and in many cases it shows. Standing head and shoulders though for me over the rest of the cast was Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar, who strikes a splendidly feisty pose as the mentally and physically scarred Hester. I look forward to seeing what she does next.Story-wise, there's not a sci-fi film that's not been looted, and a number of other films seem to be plundered too. (I can't comment on how much of this comes from the source book by Philip Reeve). The Londonmobile looks for all the world like Monty Python's ""Crimson Permanent Assurance Company""; the teenage female lead is Sarah Connors, relentlessly pursued by The Terminator; the male lead is archaologist cum hot-shot pilot Indiana Solo, leather jacket and all; there is a Blade Runner moment; a battle that is a meld of ""The Great Wall"" and Morannon from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers""; a less sophisticated aerial location from ""The Empire Strikes Back""; and another classic Star Wars moment (without the words being actually said!).Now I'm loathe to say anything bad about director Peter Jackson, after his breathtakingly memorable ""They Shall Not Grown Old"". And the film has its moments of flair, most memorably a ""life flashing before your eyes scene"" that I found genuinely moving. But overall, as an actioner, it's a bit of a mess. It's a long way from being the worse film I've seen this year by a long stroke - it kept me interested and amused in equal measure for the running time. But I think given it's initially bombed at the Box Office, any plans Jackson had to deliver a series of these movies might need to be self-funded.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Many films actually. Something of a patchwork of films- Mad Max, Star Wars, Waterworld, Howl's Moving Castle. That's just the surface.Here cities have had to load themselves up on tank tracks and roam around an apocalyptic wasteland looking for fuel and food.These gigantic monstrosities adorned with buildings, gardens, roads, and exhaust pipes never feel lived in so much as they're just eyesores.Hugo Weaving is some big higher-up of the city of London, which is just crushing it in the whole devouring other cities thing, and he's just getting started.Hera Hilmar plays Hester, a mopey survivalist seeking revenge on Weaving for killing her mom and scarring up her face, though not as badly as in the book cause you know, you gotta sell the teen lover angle.Robert Sheehan is Tom, the other teen, he looks like a complete puss next to Hester and requires saving constantly.These two encounter quirky, murderous, and freedom-fighting characters, none of which funny or memorable, as they make their way back to the final showdown with Weaving.Of course they fall in love along the way but the movie is so fast-paced and scattered you'd hardly ever recognize they even have chemistry.More problematic than how derivative and frankly joyless this all is is that the only real emotional beats take place in flashbacks I would have rather seen fleshed out than watch the actual movie.The best that could be said for this is that Peter Jackson actually didn't direct it, as the marketing seems to be misleading people to think.That dishonor goes to Christian Rivers, Jackson's storyboard artist, although it's hard to tell what drew either to this. It's a movie where even the special effects seem to be saying ""we could do alot better.""If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more";11 December 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571234/reviews?ref_=tt_sa_3;haydenagain;Not the perfect beginning for the Mortal Engines Quartet like I expected.;6/10;"The clash of urban titans has arrived to the big screen in this latest review for Mortal Engines. Does this movie live up to the book and the lore? Well let's get started.Plot:In a Dystopian future world ruined by an ancient apocalypse, gigantic Mobile Cities now dominant the landscape. Battling each other for survival and remaining resources. While those that choose to avoid it live behind a gigantic wall in eastern Asia called Shan Guao. Drawn together by an unexpected turn of Events, Hester Shaw and Tom Natsworthy are cast out of the Traction City of London into the wastes of the Great Hunting ground. Now must rely on each other to survive. As they find their way back to London, a cybernetic Bounty Hunter begins a relentless manhunt upon them.Likes:Mortal Engines is an epic, innovative and visual fuelled sci-fi adventure never before realised in filmmaking. The designs of the moving cities are really captivating and thoroughly detailed. Especially how London has a lot of striking resemblances to its real-world counterpart.
The special effects and the environment overall are stunning and breath-taking. And the action is thrilling, suspenseful and high-octane from start to finish. I also love how accurately London devours cities, just like how I imagined it in the first chapter. And the film is actually a lot faithful to the novel in terms of characters and setting unlike most other books to film.
The casting choices for the movie are pretty solid such as Hera Hilmar as Hester Shaw, Robert Sheehan as Tom Natsworthy, Hugo Weaving as Valentine and Stephen Lang as the Cyborg Shrike. Who (except for Valentine, see the dislikes below) do stay true to their characters from the novels. Stephen Lang's portrayal of the Cyborg bounty hunter Shrike is probably my biggest highlight. He gives Shrike plenty of good vibe and a sense of humanity and character when most of the others can't really grasp that interest.
But really that's all the good I have to say this film has on a visual aspect. But the Dislikes? Well... they do outweigh the needs of the few.Dislikes:So like I said I have read the book before seeing this movie recently and firstly, it doesn't truly follow the full length of it. The first half is mostly accurate to the book but after the main leads get captured by a slave town and being saved by Anna Fang that's where the story starts getting condensed for time.
From there, it tries to attempt to recreate popular themes and moments that relate too heavily upon Star Wars or Mad Max content. For example the Anti-Traction Leagues final assault on London (Not in the Book) which has a large resemblance to certain scenes in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. So not an original movie as one was to expect.The book followed three leads. Tom, Hester and Katherine Valentine. Both of them had an equal view of the events that transpire in the novel. But the movie is too concerned about a budget and a long running time to fully adapt everything that it removes the important aspects of the characters and climatic moments witnessed:1.) Katherine doesn't die in the end. Her pet husky, Dog is missing also.2.) London itself doesn't get destroyed by Medusa.3.) Tom and Hester's romance is rarely ever seen and aren't captured by another Town called Tunbridge.4.) Medusa is used first on the Shield Wall and not first used on a German city called Panzerstadt like in the Novel.5.) How Mobile Cities conserve resources for fuel without consuming them too quickly is also left unexplained.
And those were moments that fans of the book remember so well but Christian Rivers and Peter Jackson had missed and that's really shallow. If the movie was 40 minutes longer, then maybe it could have adapted the full story.
A few of the characters from the book are not properly portrayed as I hoped. Mainly with Anna Fang, Valentine and Hester herself. Anna Fang appears to be edgier and distasteful of people from Traction cities than her calm and nicer counterpart. Her personality and lines are a bit mechanical to get any connection to her or her motivations as an Anti-Tractionist.
Thaddeus Valentine is THE main villain instead of Magnus Chrome who both show a sudden switch in personalities where the Mayor despises the use of Medusa and not the latter. And he is much more of a fanatic and a power-hungry dictator and even does cynical Out-of-Character moves like try to bash all of London and its people to their death just to kill A FREAKING WALL? By the way, his plan is stupid. All he boasts about is destroying the Shield Wall and killing Anti-Tractionists. But what's the reason bro? In the movie, London isn't dying like in the book, and seems to run on enough power and resources to keep going on without quarrelling with other cities. So why kill a bunch of normal innocent people anyway regardless? It just feels far too personal to understand. So to put it mildly, his character is too underdeveloped and ludicrously insane to be taken seriously as the villain. But at least Hugo Weaving did well with the material he had to work with anyway.
I wouldn't say Hester Shaw's personality is not much like her counterpart in literature. But it's that small scar on the left side of her jaw that's the problem here. In the books she is described as being a battered sixteen year old girl with a long scar that appears over her left eye, nose and right chin. That is disappointing even from a Hollywood point of view because she could have had that scar easy without having to worry about ruining the actresses' beauty. Or you could just have it cutting over her left side of the face instead no problem. But Jackson, the scar is not strong with this one!
So I hope that wasted too much book to film criticism I included.Verdict?
When push comes to shove, Mortal Engines delivers an all new visual, steam-punked action adventure of survival that does do well to keep faith to its source material. But like most other book-to-film adaptations, it removes too much flow from the story and pacing of the book in order to be congested for time just to strive to compete with the bigger leagues of today's filmmaking world. If Peter Jackson himself was in the director's chair, maybe he could have been able to do better at adapting the movie. But I don't think it would have made much of a difference regardless. In the meantime, it looks like fans may have to wait a little while longer until The Mortal Engines Quartet gets a proper adaption. Hopefully with better results.

However, I also kept saying ""I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,"" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it.
The Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a ""puppet"" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable.
The ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying ""here I am."" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like ""meh, okay.""
The movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes ""Prince Caspian"" and ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done.
""A Wrinkle in Time"" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen. But instead of a faithful adaption, the filmmakers decided to ignore 90% of the source material.Strike 2, Disney. You've now screwed this same story up twice.";18 March 2018

Ava DuVernay's direction bordered on amateurish. Her framing was uncomfortably tight in a number of shots. And I've seen more of Oprah's inside of her nose with DuVernay's camera looking up at the giant actress than I care to remember.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;kylexile;Horrible!;2/10;This is probably the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. It's also probably the worst movie I've seen this year. The movie for starters is flat out BORING. The majority of the film is people standing around talking, and they aren't talking about anything interesting or that advances the plot in most cases. There's some beautiful imagery here, but then there's also too much green screen and CGI going on that it just loses it's luster. What is the deal with this director also? There were probably 70+ shots inches away from each actors face. It didn't look pretty and was extremely distracting to me. Somehow this director had all of these great actors and couldn't even get anything out of the majority of them. Chris Pine was about the only person that did a good job here. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's unbelievable that this is a film with a budget over $100 million. They should have never even released this travesty.;17 March 2018

I did not see any review or trailer and had moderate expectation due to Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon. Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be a huge NONSENSE. I am sorry but the three kids just don't know how to act. Meg Murry was like""huh......ah......hmm......huh......I don't know... I am not sure....AHAHAH"" throughout the movie; the little boy who acted Charles Wallace was fine but overacting for the most of the time; the teenage boy was just showing ""I am so conscious of my good-looking and I am seducing you"". What the heck?! More importantly, the plot is all over the place and filled with cliche. I am for girl power but this is just so cynical and use girl power as a selling point and nothing else makes sense. Witherspoon and Pine are fine but were eclipsed by this bad screenplay.

There were moments (if not the entire movie) in which all the magic could be seen as fake and special effect only. The acting for the main character is bad. Very bad. I could tell it was too acted.

While the name of the movie was A Wrinkle in Time, the movie itself was something that had died a horrible death, strangled by the need to be diverse and carrying a ""powerful message"" that was hidden in shocked disbelief. The scriptwriter and director clearly did not care about the plot or power that existed in the book (the final battle between Meg and the brain ran chills up my spine in the book, but was actually boring in the movie), but instead focused on a message...and such a message that the ""MESSAGE"" (caps courtesy of the interviews) was more important than the plot, actors and actresses, CGI, conflicts, resolutions or anything else. If you want a ""MESSAGE"" and don't feel like spending time in the religious institution of your choice, I might raise my rating tp 2 stars for you.By the way, if you have never read the book, I suggest you watch the movie, then read the book (that way giving the movie every chance) and then rate the movie.";11 March 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;psifi872;Unfaithful;1/10;"The main problem with the movie is it so very unfaithful to the book. It doesn't even attempt to remain true to what the book is truly about.First of all, the book is a Christian fantasy, written by a Christian author, Madeleine L'Engle. The movie ignores L'Engle's faith to the point of mockery. To add insult to injury, the movie doesn't even try to add in something that might satisfy in it's place. Not that anything could, but an attempt would have taken away a bit of the sting. Instead, we're left with banal generics about ""light,"" ""darkness,"" and the ""universe,"" with some daytime pop psychology mixed in. For an example, the movie has Mrs. Which, played by Oprah Winfrey, say ""The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of darkness."" What rubbish! I genuinely hate that line. Theologically, even just morally, it's garbage. Light doesn't have to outrun the dark. Good is not weaker than evil. The smallest speck of light is enough to brighten the most encompassing darkness. That's the message we should be sending children, not some banal quip that makes evil seem stronger than it really is. The movie's fatal flaw is shown mainly in the characters, but also a bit in how the plot was handled. I'll start with the characters, but I want to say something first. I don't agree with those who say the acting was bad. The diverse cast was mostly wonderful! But, even the most talented actor can only do so much, with a bad script. The cast did the best that probably could be done with what they were given. Sadly, what they were given was trash. That isn't their fault though. Chris Pine played Alex Murray, a character horrible misinterpreted by the movie. In the book, Murray is a renowned and VERY well-respected scientist, not some outsider on the fringes of his field. This is a man who is consulted by the President, at times! His work with the tesseract was a group effort with other scientists, not just his wife. The movie utterly trashed his motives for developing the tesseract. He didn't want to ""shake hands with the universe,"" whatever that means. Murray in the book was a man of faith, working for the good of his fellow men. The tesseract was supposed to help people, not just fulfill some personal agenda. Murray in the book took risks, yes, but as part of his responsibilities to his team and country. Equally flawed was the movie's version of Mrs. Whatsit. In the book, Mrs. Whatsit is, frankly, an angel, who used to be a star, before sacrificing herself in a battle against evil...a battle she won. She was a fun character, though, playing a game at being human. She dressed as an old tramp and stole sheets. The sheets in the book, though, weren't stolen to create some magnificent robe for her to look beautiful in, for her vanity. Nope. In the book, she took the sheets to make cheesy ghosts, in order to scare people away from the haunted house. The worst thing about the movie Mrs. Whatsit was how she treated Meg. Consistently and frequently through the movie, Mrs. Whatsit bullied and belittled Meg, showing intense dislike and openly wishing she wasn't there. What an incredibly terrible message to send! This is supposed to be a wise leader, teacher, and guide, but that's how she treats a child? Compare that to the book, where Mrs. Whatsit is playful and gentle, where Mrs. Whatsit's assurance of her love is instrumental in Meg defeating It. I'm a fan of Reese Witherspoon, but she was so wrong here. Frankly, Kathy Bates would have been a much better choice. Another character who should have been happy, playful, and kind was the Happy Medium. Zach Galifianakis played the role as a grump, for whatever reason. Frankly, this is the role Michael Peña should have played. His comedy style would have been perfect for a well-meaning seer trying to show the kids comforting things, their mothers, and instead showing them scenes of pain, as it was in the book. I don't know why they got rid of this bit of character development in favor of CGI crap about balancing on rocks. It's just one time of many, where something deep was replaced with something shallow. Zach Galifianakis could play the Man with Red Eyes, if he can pull off legal evil, a creepy bureacrat, with a deep sense of menace, highlighted by a fake cheerfulness. Finally, we get to Charles Wallace. And, yes, he should be called that, not Charles or Charlie, no. He's Charles Wallace, because it shows he's not ordinary. In the book, Charles Wallace is a gentle, thoughtful child, who very often knows what his sister is thinking and feeling. He's a boy who listens. This is a very important part of his character. He has a wisdom to him that is far beyond his years. He's not a typical kid who screams and yells, when someone is being mean to his sister. Charles Wallace barely talks in front of other people at all! There should be something otherworldly about the boy. Instead, McCabe was directed to play him as a bit wild and mouthy and Charles Wallace's wisdom, understanding, and intelligence were barely shown at all. Not only is this a sad waste of his character, but makes the sequels impossible to get right. They made the classic mistake of telling us Charles Wallace is special, instead of showing us. Poor Calvin. They didn't so much get his character wrong, as fail to give him character at all. He was just undeveloped. Of course, they ruined the possibility of a good adaptation of A Swiftly Tilting Planet, the third in L'Engle's trilogy, by changing his home life from a poor family, with lots of kids, to him being an only child with just a dad. The only character treated worse was Aunt Beast, who was left out entirely, which is shame. Well, they also left out Sandy and Denys, the Murray twins. A single scene with them would have been just fine. As for the plot, I think a single example will highlight how wrong the movie went. In the book, the children arrive on Camazotz. They walk through a suburban neighborhood and see children ""playing."" The boys are bouncing balls and girls and skipping rope, all simultaneously to a certain ""rhythm."" Yes, the movie almost gets that much right. The children see that one child alone is out of rhythm, dropping his ball and unable to keep in sync. When the mother's call the children in, the errant child leaves his ball behind. They try to return the ball and the mother is terrified. She assures Meg and the others that there haven't been any ""incidents,"" in a long time. The reader sees that although everything looks neat and tidy, no one is really happy. Submission to evil brings terror and pain, not joy. This deep, potentially moving scene is reduced to make room for a shallow, unnecessary scene where a CGI forest attacks the kids. Speaking of out of character, the entire planet of Camazotz is exactly that. There would not a beach scene like that on Camazotz. Camazotz is legal evil, all the way. The evil of Camazotz does not play those sorts of mind games. It doesn't so much try and confuse you, as try to get you to confuse yourself. In the movie, the children are given a meal, by the Man with Red Eyes. They are given some sort of nutrient base, but the Man can create the illusion of a turkey dinner. Charles Wallace, however, can't be fooled, and knows the meal is shapeless and tasteless, like sand. They weren't actually given sand to eat. The meal did what a meal should do, at least on the surface. It provided nutrition, but without real joy. It was body fuel, with everything better about it drained away. For me, that's the perfect metaphor for this movie, as opposed to the book. The movie tells the story and kills some time, but with all the real joy of the story neglected and ignored.I really wished they had done a good job. I wanted to like this movie, so much. When you make a beloved novel into a movie, you have an automatic audience in the fans of the book. Integrity demands you give that audience what you are promising them. This movie fails to deliver.";26 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;maileyb123;Spoilers ahead;1/10;"I didn't even want to see this to begin with. But I was dragged by people who only wanted to see if because Reese Witherspoon is in it. So to begin with.. the plot is not good. There hardly even is one. The special effects were mediocre but not horrible.. the characters were two dimensional and you can't really connect to them. I don't even understand the point of Calvinother than Meg's love interest. But WHY DOES SHE NEED A LOVE INTEREST. She is a child and while she may have a crush, there is no need for there to be a romantic storyline within this movie. Charles Wallace mentioned that he cane along for diplomacy, but where do we even see that come into play? Meg is just dragging him along the whole time. And on that topic, how does Charles Wallace know all of this stuff. Sure, he's a smart kid, but are we supposed to believe he's psychic or something? And he can just summon the universe? Also, why is the universe so concerned with them? Don't they have other things to spend their time on? So anyways.. the three Mrs show up and oprah's Character is like 20ft taller than everyone else.. why? Because she's oprah, that's why... and that cheapens the feel of the movie. We get it.. you're Oprah. So then they go to this magical land and find out what direction her dad went. So the Reese Witherspoon changes into some giant flying creature so they can go look for their father. But the director focused on the magic of flying and the fun of it that we lost the point of even being up there. There was literally no point to that entire scene other than to put in some ""cool"" special effects. They saw ""the darkness"" though. It's supposedly ""pure evil."" How pure of an evil can it really be in a PG Disney movie... huh? Anyways, they meet Zach galifinakis to help find their father. (Also, why wouldn't the Mrs be able to find him or help meg find him if they are literally the universe with a bunch of magical powers??) anywho.. galifinakis shows a vision of her dad discovering love is the frequency needed in order to terrasect. (If that's the case, how do people NOT terrasect). And that he went into the darkness. So suddenly the darkness is it's own planet? And Meg risks the lives of THE UNIVERSE in order to go into the darkness.. because that's a good idea. So she gets tested by the darkness and meg is the only one who can resist it.. what happened to Charles Wallace being the all-knowing leader of the group? He falls under the spell of the darkness almost immediately. And also, why was he already across the wall? Did it not fit their ""love story"" plot to have a young(er) child intervene? So now Charles Wallace is evil and suddenly has magical powers. But again.. how evil can he be in a Disney movie? Not very.. and that makes it laughable. So meg again passes more tests and finds her father. Who hasn't aged a day, his beard hasn't grown, and has survived in a small room with nothing? What did he eat? Where did he go to the bathroom? Then all of the sudden the darkness REALLY wants meg and just meg. (Again I wonder why such a powerful being would be so interested in these specific children) and meg gets tested some more. All of this just being a lesson to teach her to love herself, to have self esteem. And that's the cure. That's what strongly weakens the darkness. Again... why does the universe (light and dark) care SO MUCH about one little girl's self esteem. Then the three Mrs tell meg that she's the next ""great person"" in line with ghandi, Marie curie, and various others. Just because she knows basic physics, can figure out a puzzle, and loves herself??? Also, another thing I forgot to mention,; Mrs who can only speak in quotes because she's not strong enough to speak her own thoughts. Then when they are on the darkness' planet, she speaks her own words and oprah explains that it's because the planet is making her weak.... so how does that make sense????? Anyways. It was a horrible movie with tons of plot holes and a really bad plot line. The director focused more on the special affects and costumes than she did on a script, plot, or acting. But hey.. oprah is in it.";16 March 2018

I did not realize how over-the-top the delivery would be from experienced actors. The 3 Mrses delivered their lines with an unnatural almost preachy zeal. I wonder if this was intentional, what the director was looking for. The young actors did great, Reid, Miller and especially Deric McCabe. Galifianakis' gives a good performance. Perhaps being a 'Happy Medium' he did not have to over-state like the other experienced actors. I think Peña is a great actor. His character lacks antagonism but I suspect that is to keep it friendly for small children.
The ending/climax happens quickly without proper build, but this is good, because you will want to get out of there quicker. The movie was very corny, even for younger audience.

There was this bizarre desire by the director to fit in pop songs that had seemingly no connection to what was going on in a scene. That was annoying. Everything was over emoted. I think the director thought she was creating a brilliant, deep movie. It wasn't at all. Shallow as all get out.

Yet, there is no context for why he know this or feels this way. To this point, Meg hasn't really shown anything incredible and there is no back story for these two except that they barely know each other. This is the kind of disconnected dialogue you can expect from the entire movie. Monologues and speeches that are suppose to have gravity and inspire but feel out of place. Where did it all go wrong? Is this a poor script, poor editing, or poor directing?The only character I really enjoyed was Charles Wallace, a name you get to know quite well because they say his name about 500 times.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;NoloContendere;An example of a story co-opted for political purposes;1/10;"Ava DuVernay is best known for her directing of ""Selma"", an excellent film about the civil rights struggle in Jim Crow-era Alabama. With AWIT, DuVernay appears to have tried to continue her personal civil rights march by way of creating a children's film that is chock-full of good messages for young girls, especially minority young girls.That's an honorable intention, but it's unfortunate that she decided to advance her agenda using the name of a well-known, well-loved children's book. Because that's what this is: DuVernay changed Madeleine L'Engle's story in severe ways to promote her own message instead of Ms. L'Engle's. DuVernay made the focal point of the story a young black girl's life struggles, which was not the point of the original novel. That would be fine if she had created something new and original, but a lot of people who grew up loving the original book were rightly disappointed or offended by the changed focus. The film also has a misanthropist (anti-male) slant that was off-putting to my family; none of the male characters are remotely competent, and nearly all of them betray the main character at some point (Murray disappears for four years, Calvin eats the beach food, Charles Wallace becomes the bad guy) or are simply evil in their own right (the It is... itself, Michael Pena kidnaps Charles Wallace, Calvin's dad is verbally abusive to him). Even male characters who are minor players are portrayed as helpless or ineffective (Zach Galifianakis's clueless guru, Principal Jenkins). The movie's heroes are all women, period, and that cannot be by accident. Just as telling is towards the end of the film when Ms. Who is naming off legendary heroes, all except one were non-white. Again, this cannot be by accident, and is just as wrong as it would have been if all the heroes she had named were white.There are plenty of other posts about the poor acting, awful pacing, lousy direction, and overuse of facial close-up shots (DuVernay uses close-ups with the same proliferation that J.J. Abrams uses lens flare), so I won't go into those here. Suffice it to say, this movie is AWIT in name only";10 April 2018

Actors were of different skin tones, but were otherwise identical in facial expression, dress, etc. Creepy and very much true to the source material. But then it just folded away like it was all an illusion. Which completely undid the point.In the book, IT forced mindless compliance and called it peace. Meg saved her little brother through the one thing IT couldn't understand (or control): love. 
Given the number of people (across the political spectrum) who are trying to force orderly compliance, I was really hoping that the movie would do justice to these themes. Instead, it ran more with a trite ""love yourself, love conquers all"" kind of message. Trite and nearly meaningless.The screenwriters evidently missed the point of the book. Too bad. It is an excellent book.";9 March 2018

Now that I have seen the movie, Nope. Nope. Nope. The ruined ever facets of the book. I might of blamed the failures on staring children, but the Narnia series also stars children and does a great job, not perfect but good enough.

It comes across like a fever dream of a My Little Pony obsessed child. I must be honest in that I had no idea what the hell was going on. And no, its not because I didn't understand the overall meaning but rather the slip shod way the narrative tried to portray it. It's just jam packed with Maguffins with the odd sprinkling of real science to try and give it some legitimacy. And plot holes..so, so many! I think what realy annoyed me though was the PS1 type CGI flying lettuce. And the way the characters kept calling the kid ""Charles Wallace"". Is that his name cos that ain't a name. Really annoyed me for some weird reason. What really annoyed me though was the way the film portrayed horrific human behaviour as the influence of some alien entity. That's a bit of a terrible message....you're not responsible.

I'm not picky about fantasy violence in avengers or Star Wars. It makes its point and moves on. I had good faith that Disney would bring a beautiful show to us. 
This movie had three beautiful Mrs. characters. That's what I liked. That's all I liked. 
They spent far too much time demonizing a young character in a dark place. We don't need to be immersed in evil to know its place in this story, or in life. It's PG! If I wanted to see a possessed child (WHO really DOES?) I would've chosen a different genre. 
It gave us all a bad feeling.. I kept waiting for good parts to come in, but it had to teach a lesson and leave everyone feeling nearly as souless as the IT.. I just don't understand the point. Are you trying to make kids feel dark things when they are coming to be lightened and uplifted? Show the problem, but don't become the problem! 
I really couldn't care less about the concerns with the Universalism themes.. like, it's shown in many of the recent space travel movie concepts, interstellar really comes to mind.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;bakmasha;A Wrinkle in Time? More Like A Waste Of Time!;1/10;"Going into the theater I was with my seventh grade sister and my boyfriend. We were just finding a way to pass the time by going to the movies and to just hang out because what else do you really do on a Sunday night in the winter. I'm not very critical of movies or actors, I like most films I see even if they are a bit cheesy/cringe worthy and I never really knew what ""bad acting"" looked like, so walking into this I was expecting a mediocre film. I heard good things about the book that was published in 1962, lots of people said it was a classic that everyone adored. The casting also raised the stakes a bit considering Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and, one of my favorite actors, Zach Galifianakis were in it. They were also the face of all of the commercials shown for this science fiction film. The first fifteen minutes I was thinking to myself, ""This isn't very good so far, but I'm going to give it some time, I'm sure it will get better!"" Boy was I wrong. The acting and plot may have been some of the worst I have ever seen. Let me take this apart step by step. 
 Let's start with the plot. I haven't read the book, but I read a brief synopsis before we went in so that I could have a better understanding. To summarize it, the main character Meg (Storm Reid) and her younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) have been left alone with their mother after their scientist father has disappeared for five years. Their father had thought up of a concept called a tesseract. A tesseract is the fifth dimension that can shorten the distances across both time and space therefore, forming a ""wrinkle in time"", hence the name of the movie. The kids, especially Meg, have been dealing with the absence of their father very poorly, affecting their social life and school work. Out of nowhere, (literally with no reason) Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) shows up and starts talking nonsense about their father and his study. After this incident, the kids get involved with two other mysterious astral travelers (Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling). Now this is where it gets messy; the director did a bad job explaining on what was happening and why. One minute the kids and the travelers would be on another planet, and the next they would encounter an ""evil force"". To sum it up, the whole movie was these kids looking for their father with these mysterious travelers and !!SPOILER ALERT!! They find him and they all live happily ever after. The transitions between each part of the movie was unclear and confusing. The director did NOT do a good job.
 Now, I don't know much about acting and I haven't really noticed bad acting before but this movie was the definition of bad acting. The main character, Meg, was honestly terrible. I just remember this one line that she said and it made me cringe so much. Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling weren't bad at acting but it just seemed like they didn't fit in with this type of movie. I view them as serious actors but this movie is like a joke in my eyes. The script was just not good, at all. The actors would say obvious things that just made you go ""Really? Are you really that dumb?"" I do give the movie some credit for having good actors to star in it to attract attention but that does not mean it was a good movie. 
 The one good thing that I will say about this awful movie is that the special effects were pretty cool. It was interesting and was probably the only thing that kept my attention throughout the movie. The whole concept of this movie was good and it has potential, but the way it was approached was just really terrible. I think after all the reviews this movie has gotten, the producers would do many things differently. So, to sum everything up, this is my least favorite movie I have ever seen and I was VERY disappointed. Definitely a WASTE of time. The only reason why I would tell someone to watch this film is for me to discuss the things that were so bad about it with that person. I wish I could wrinkle that time when I was in the theater.";1 June 2018

Some people think because they have an original story and a camera that it'll make a great, amazing movie people will be talking about forever. It's sad that Hollywood will make this crap even after our time here, and reboots will eventually be it's only option to turn a profit. Movies are becoming too predictable and boring nowadays, and now this movie forces parents to spend money on it because it captures the eyes of their children. ""Bright colors and relatable teens"" are all you need for the overpriced ticket. Do yourself a favor, learn from this movie and don't waste money on a movie like this until you do the research.

Okay, maybe a part of it has something to do with it being based on a book, and also my brother wanted to see it (not that he knew anything about it anyway), but in the end it was one of those painfully annoying Disney films that left me bored out of my brains the entire time.
 Basically it is about a couple of kids, one of them a young teenager, another a child, whose parents are scientists. Anyway, they Dad goes missing so not surprisingly they become very difficult students (not to mention that they also attract the ire of their peers). However, out of the blue, these magical women appear (good witches if you will), who take them on a journey across the universe in an attempt to find their father, only to discover that there is this nameless evil that basically makes everybody behave like jerks.
 I guess you can see where this is going - they defeat this nameless evil (which is call the It - see, I told you it was a nameless evil), and then find their father, and they all go back to playing happy families. All the while, the bullies stop being bullies because, well, nameless evil, and the random boy that decided to join their group because he had this urge to just leave his house and start wondering around a part of the town he never goes to because, well, plot point, finally plucks up the courage to go back home and confront his abusive father (like, that ever works in real life).
 I told my brother that it was a fantasy movie, and yes, you could say that it pretty much exists in the realm of fantasy, because I doubt abusive fathers suddenly have a change of heart just because their son decides to stand up to them, and bullies don't stop being bullies because some nameless and unidentified evil is destroyed because, well, love is supposed to conquer all, and that works out because some person just screams out 'I love you' over and over again, and the nameless evil stops being evil and turns into sunshine and lollypops because, well, that's what happens when you start screaming out 'I love you' over and over again.
 Well, if you get the impression that I didn't like this movie, then you're not wrong there. In fact I won't even go as far as calling it a fairy tale because, well, that sort of ruins it for some of the really cool fairy tales out there. Nah, I'll just call this a Disney film and leave it at that, though I do have to admit that while they have made some absolute gems, in the end, a lot of their stuff is just cliched and rubbish.";1 April 2018

This had so much potential and it was just boring. Lot's of screen time wasted showing how great the special effects were, at the expense of having an interesting, coherent, plot. If you have not read the book, you might not even be able to follow the movie. The movie starts numerous unnecessary sub-plots that are forgotten by the end of the movie. At some points it even sounds like the characters are mocking the writing.  The child actors did as good a job as anybody could with horrible writing. The adult actors were mediocre, but also had to deal with horrible dialog. Reese Witherspoon was the exception, she did a great job, but may have had a better character to work with.Many of the effects were pretty good. Unfortunately, this is not 1979, so the effects alone can't carry the picture like in Star Trek , The Motion Picture. If you want to see a better adaptation of the book, watch the 2003 Canadian TV version.;9 March 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;madpigmadpig;Extremely disappointing considering what they could have done with the story;3/10;"I saw A Wrinkle in Time today. The first half hour or so had potential, as the little brother was set up as an articulate champion of justice type who dressed down two teachers for spreading malicious gossip about him and his family, and then supported his sister. All this while apparently marshaling the powers that be of the universe to help find their missing father. The sister started out with some potential too, beating up a particularly vicious bully and walking out on a principal who was trying to tear her down without getting the whole story behind her actions first. The acting and makeup for the 3 universe goddess ladies was rather off-putting and honestly came off as TV movie quality, but the CGI once they crossed over to a new place was impressive. Unfortunately, the whole movie falls flat on its face immediately after that and never recovers. Leaving the heavy-handed and insufficiently heartfelt scene with the seer out, the little brother disappears briefly without explanation (only to reappear later also without explanation) during which time the kids run through a supernatural natural disaster of sorts and escape in a barely believable (even in the context of fantasy) way. Shortly after the little brother reappears, he touches the hand of one baddie and suddenly turns into a power-mad villain, which makes no sense since he showed no signs of avarice up to that point and not a drop of darkness in his personality to be used in turning him. If anything, the setup made him seem more likely to end up the hero of the story. This is just clumsy writing. When they finally find the father, despite the fact he's been trapped in the core of evil for the whole universe for 4 years, he shows no signs of having changed in any way - plus he was way too easy to find but that's another issue. Then, even though he's supposed to have been trapped there, he just decides to teleport him and his daughter back home at will. What!?! Couldn't he have done that, say 4 years earlier if it was that simple!?! Also, when he teleports away and the daughter wills herself to stay to go after her brother, the boyfriend is nowhere near and in the end the daughter and her brother go home without the boyfriend... and yet he's there when they arrive home... with no explanation whatsoever. Oh, and one more plot hole regarding the boyfriend. The little brother asked him to come along because they needed his sense of diplomacy, but he never used it once. He barely even spoke. Both he and the little brother had considerable potential as characters, but were not really used at all. What a waste. Finally, the climax ""battle"" scene of the film kind of undermined the moral of the story (that you should like yourself the way you are) since the argument the daughter made to un-evil her brother was that they loved each other and therefore he couldn't be evil. Huh?Oh, one last note. There was one little moment when the bother yelled to the sister ""Shut up, Meg!"" Surely someone working on that movie must have seen the show Family Guy once in their life and realized that line would have all the wrong pop culture connotations for a moderately large portion of the audience? I mean, seriously, I don't watch that show and even I know that catchphrase. There was a lot of laughter in the theater at that moment, and I think that's why.I'm guessing something important in the original written story was excised from the screenplay to fill it so full of holes. If not, then this is just a very disappointing story all around. Thematically and stylistically, it wants to be Neverending Story, but it just isn't. At all. Not even close.";10 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;dwh-56524;A diabolical puzzle on celluloid;5/10;"Before I begin this review, I would just like to say that I don't know how I feel about this film, and I'm not sure I ever will, hence the 5/10 rating. Having read the original source material for A Wrinkle in Time, this is a strange goddamn adaptation, to say the very least. In my eyes, there are a few reasons for this. Firstly, some of the changes it has made to the original source material are baffling, while others actually make sense. For instance, ""Red"" (read: the Man with the Red Eyes, the physical mouthpiece of It (or, according to this film, the It. Why add the ""the""?) in the original novel) looks like a poor man's Willy Wonka, but quantum entanglement being the mumbo-jumbo Meg's dad uses for tessering instead of a pure wormhole is indeed a well thought-out change. The flowers are a stupid addition (although not altogether pointless to the plot), but the change regarding what Mrs. Whatsit transforms into is rather good. All of what they did to Camazotz did my head in as to whether I liked it or not, including the stairwell sequence, which to me might have well been conceived of on
Secondly, it is obvious that the message of this film was tweaked a bit to have a bit of commentary regarding womens' body images and how it affects them, as well as empowerment of women, and I am certain there are cries of ""SJW-ism"" and what not in this review section. A film like this attracts those sort of unpleasant reviews like honey does flies. I personally don't know how I feel about it. Ask me Tuesday whether it was garbage and you won't get the same answer Wednesday. I don't even know if I care.
Thirdly, while the performances of the three immortal girls aren't too shabby, the rest of the cast is hit or miss. Storm Reid is alright, but she doesn't get as many lines to work with as I was expecting, oddly enough, being the protagonist and all. Calvin's actor's performance is as interesting as watching a sundial's shadow move. Charles Wallace's actor, Boognish bless him, is trying incredibly hard to nail his character, but falls way short, sadly. Shame, too, as he probably would have been better with better direction.
To summarize, I do not know if I recommend this film. Ask Schrodinger's cat instead.";15 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;harperdiscoveredemail;You're Better Off With The Book;4/10;"I grew up really loving ""A Wrinkle in Time"". It was my absolute favorite book. In fact, as I write this review right now, the same copy I was given as an 8 year old is on my desk, nice and familiar and reminding me of days long gone. When I heard they were adapting it to a big-budget film with Disney, I was mostly excited, with a few reservations. Here was the chance to see this great story communicated through a new media!However, I went to see the film and was sorely disappointed. To begin with, it didn't start on a dark and stormy night! One of the most iconic lines in literature, and they saved it for after a needless flashback that oversimplified and explained subtleties in the book.Aside from that, the first half was pretty decent. It mostly followed the book, and I liked the characters of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which. I wasn't expecting to like Mindy or Reese in their roles, but I feel they did a good job. And I did really like Oprah as Mrs Which, which I did have reservations about. I started to have a bad feeling when they landed on Uriel. When Mrs Whatsit shifted into her ""other form"", it looked like a depressing, CGI version of a piece of flying lettuce. Not at all like the majestic Mrs Whatsit on my cover! However, I tried to hold on nonetheless.While there were several little unsettling changes, it all started to veer quite far away from the book the moment they landed on Camazotz. Without going into terrible detail, let's just say that the filmmakers completely missed the point of what the book was originally trying to portray! Entire chapters were left out! Important character development was skipped! And all of Calvin's best scenes in the book were cut, making him some sort of useless tagalong!With all of their skipping, it ruined the original plot and many other good points. To its credit, however, it did have lovely visuals. The other worlds were very beautiful, and while Camazotz was completely inaccurate, it was gorgeous. I also didn't mind the majority of the casting, whether or not I'd agree with it. But, it just lacked the soul and subtlety of the original text.";10 March 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;mdavidsons;Warm-hearted and Visually Stunning;9/10;I really can't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. It's been a while since I read the books, so I remember almost none of the plot, but this film captured what I loved about A Wrinkle in Time: the wonder, the mystery, the power of family. Amid the glittery makeup and gorgeous special effects, the message about family and love really anchored the film, and the emotional realism of the script and actors spoke to me in a way that other reboots of children's stories haven't. It's hard to adapt a book into a film, and avid fans will inevitably find fault. But this film reminds me of Hayao Miyazaki's masterful interpretation of Howl's Moving Castle, another instance in which a film riffs off a more convoluted plot to give it new life.;14 March 2018

I believe that everything was rushed and didn't have any meaning. When you saw the children meet Oprah, Kaling, and Witherspoon on the other planet, this was in the trailer, that was the highlight of the movie. I thought it would have been visually stunning, but it lacked in that department too. This movie was pretty much Disney's Eragon. It failed miserably. If you want to see the best parts of the movie without seeing the movie, please just watch the trailer. I expected so much from Ava DuVernay in this movie, but was left wondering and confused.

Storm Reid as the Meg is too annoying in the beginning to be likable, but she does have talent. The other child stars are bland. In short, as a movie fan, I rarely find a movie boring, but this is one of those boring movies.

In a Nutshell: Despite its best intentions, A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing as a film, although kids will probably still like it.
Based on the very popular book A Wrinkle in Time (Time Quintet) by Madeleine L'Engle , it doesn't quite deliver the magic I hoped for, especially since screenwriter Jennifer Lee had done such great work with Disney's Frozen , Zootopia (DVD) Wreck-It Ralph and even Frozen Fever. 
Tips for Parents:LOTS of moral lessons kids and parents can feel good about.
Kids in peril
Mrs. Whatsit uses the word ""prodigious."" In case your kids ask you what it means, you can tell them ""remarkably or impressively great in extent, size, or degree."" Your kids will be so impressed that you know. 
Bullying
No profanity. Thank you!
Multi-racial familyUplifting theme: The only way to defeat the darkness is to become the light.
Love rescues
""Be a warrior."" - Mrs. Which (Oprah)
Center yourself. Become one with the universe and yourself.
""The wound is the place where the light enters you."" - Mrs. WhoThings I liked:Chris Pine! I love him in anything.
Storm Reid is adorable and did a pretty good job, although a bit straight-faced during most of the movie. Her best scene, by far, was with Chris Pine towards the end.
It's a colorful ride. The gossiping flower scene was the best part of the film.
Fun hairstyles on the Mrs.'s.
Zach Galifinakus was pretty funny and did a lot with the very small role he was given.
I think frequencies and energy are so interesting. If you're fascinated by science, check out A Wrinkle in Time Book of Fun, Facts, and Science Energy is everything.
Some of the scenes were shot in gorgeous New Zealand.
Things I didn't like:While director DuVernay was very enthusiastic and creative, her vision was probably overly ambitious, resulting in a choppy mess.
A lot of the green screens look fake with some special effects that don't really work. 
Some weird moments with missing details. Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.
Deric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.
I couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.
Cliched scene where someone says, ""Do you trust me?""
Mindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. 
Over-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The ""Mrs's"" looked more fake than magical. 
You don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.
The dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.
Lots of close-ups that don't really work.
A scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.
I actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.
There's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing ""it."" 
Kids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch. While Oprah really is bigger than life (I laughed when Mrs. Which was gigantic), her acting is not good. I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.
Surprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too. It felt forced and contrived.
Interesting lines:""You can do this. You're choosing not to."" - Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis)

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;lordorwell;Very good and thought provoking;9/10;I had been looking forward to this movie not only because the trailers made it look like it had potential, but I have also read the entire book series. Fortunately, it lives up to it's potential. Amazing acting, incredible special effects, and a screenplay and directing that doesn't leave you guessing what the plot is. There are many scenes in the movie that are just plain creepy so keep that in mind. The only reason I did not give this a 10/10 is because I had a few issues with how the father was portrayed at the end.Make sure you know what you are getting into if you watch this. It's not for people looking for brain-dead plots. You need to have intelligence to enjoy it, and movies like this are incredibly rare to come by nowadays.;10 November 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;StregaAsuka;A Wrinkle to Your Time;4/10;The main problem with this movie is not the plot. As the movie is based on an acclaimed novel, which indeed is, it's not the fault of the story, but the fault lies on how the script has been adapted. It is true that is not an easy story to adapt to the big screen and less easy is to addapt it to a film under two hours. The fault doesn't specifically lie on which things have been prioritized before others and which things have been changed (skin colors, gender, character with more weight, characters that disappear). The things that have been changed aren't the cause of the failure of this movie, but most of the problem is which parts of the story have been shown and how long have been presented to the audience. While the book keeps going at a fast pace, never stopping, never letting you breath, the movie goes fast in some aspects that should be taken more slowly and goes really slowly in some aspects that should be gone in two seconds.Plus, the movie seem like a Oprah show. Why is she taking so much screen? (literally speaking, if you have watched the movie you will know what I am talking about). It's ok to put black actors on the screen to appeal to a bigger audience, but please, the main character is the girl, not Oprah's characters. Just watching the credits roll at the end of the film makes you realize who owns the movie (if you haven't done it before) , in terms of money at least.If you have read the book, you will feel a bit out-of-place, because this is not the story you have read. This is a boring story, with characters that make no sense, and scenes that make less sense. If you haven't read the book, you will mostly likely want not to create a wrinkle in time, but in space. More specifically to your sofa. A wrinkle to your sofa.#AWrinkleInTime becomes a #AWasteOfTime;18 March 2018

Following Meg on her adventure through the universe to find her father and discover the power within herself was a wonderful adventure. It was also a great reminder that we are worthy just the way we are. This is a great movie to go see with your pre-teens and teens! If you want a discussion guide to use afterwards we have one up on our blog now. 
Yes, there were differences from the book. But I was not expecting it to be exactly like the book and I was not disappointed. Yes, there were some Christian pieces of the book watered down- but I still saw God in so many places in the movie! The themes of light and love shone through. 
It was wonderfully acted and the imagery was beautiful!

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;SpitfireLil;What Did I Just Watch?;1/10;"I read A Wrinkle in TIme as a child, nearly fifty years ago. I have to admit that I don't remember much about the details of the story or the characters, but even with that, there was a lot left out. This is the story that taught me what dimensions are and what properties constitute each one. As I became an illustrator/ 3-D animator, this is a pretty big deal - and they completely left it out of the movie; they didn't even try to delve into the science.
What this ended up looking like was some type of anti-bullying message-movie (and isn't that all the rage these days?) I rarely watch a movie based on a book before reading the book. In this instance, I feel compelled to go back to the book and rereading it to see how badly the movie got it wrong.";1 October 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;lukefan;Dear Ava DuVernay and Jennifer Lee;2/10;"I admire the director and production team for the colorblind casting. I give this film 4 stars for the great cast. I only wish they had spent more time highlighting why the book was so good to begin with. They didn't have to put it all on Meg rescuing everyone. In the book it's a team effort out of love and friendship, so the parts of the book where they cut out the other characters sacrificing themselves or offering to sacrifice themselves for each other and the total unselfishness of characters like Calvin or Meg's father could have helped pack the emotional punch of this movie. Calvin had much more to do in the book, why cut that out? Giving him nothing to do didn't help develop why he is there to help Meg. He and Meg had growth in their character arcs in ths book. Why just show 1 scene of Calvin having problems with his father, why not develop that a bit more. Develop Charles Wallace being continuously teased or show a montage of it if you're short on time. I really really really hate they didn't have Aunt Beast in there, the ending was totally silly and half-cooked. And developing the three Missuses much more...maybe DuVernay should have picked the TV miniseries format with a longer running time with more room for character motivation and development and had a screenwriter writing more true to the spirit of the actual novel.
I truly admire the colorblindness the film tried to be, but it would have helped to have more meaty story on this film's bones and kept in more of the best things about the book than focusing on the CGI. Way too watered down for my tastes. Respect the audience! We are smarter than you think we are!";28 March 2018

I did not understand at first what exactly was wrong. And then I realized I loved the story I love the actors but did not like Oprah in this movie. I'm not quite sure if it was the distracting make up or the fact that it was just Oprah delivering Oprahlike lines there was no transcendence into the character. And I do realize that, that was her character. But it played too close to her real life. I wonder if she switch places with one of the other ""misses"" if it would've been better overall for the movie. It's not a bad movie It's just Oprah was too much - too much distracting make-up, too heavy of a custom, just too much. If they were supposedly made of light and guiding and searching for young warriors, Oprah was too heavy and grounded to be light and it left an imbalance between the three. The young actors, Chris, Gugu, Mindy, & Reese did their jobs and were immersed in their characters. Maybe it was me every time Oprah spoke it was just Oprah not her character.

Weeks before the film came out, people vented their anger about it in the comments section of a NY Times article on it. They were afraid of a darker skinned female lead - not staying true to its source material, they claim. It is this kind of fear that the film challenges us to see and understand before it consumes us.
This story is not about skin color, nor sexual anatomy. It is about the power of love and the destruction of fear. The director does an excellent job creating this moral lesson with cinematic vision that both children and adults can appreciate. It will move you if you have a willingness to be moved. There are some very significant lines spoken in this film, that if truly taken to heart, could change lives.";11 March 2018

Granted I have never read the book, but this movie made me want to. I don't care if it doesn't do justice to the novel, we can not overlook the overlying message this movie tries to portray to its viewers. It is a beautiful work of art on its own, visually, and through story-telling. It is all about the conquering of our own insecurities and faults through the power of love, a force so strong it bends space and time. Shame on anyone who discredits this movie due to its discontinuities to its source material. This movie is a verdict of how we should be living and treating others, and to deny its quality is bringing the darkness out into this world. It's a beautiful movie, touching, and very teaching.

Book: ""...was it a tramp? It seemed small for Meg's idea of a tramp.The age or sex was impossible to tell, for it was completely bundled up in clothes. Several scarves of assorted colours were tied about the head, and a man's fel hat perched atop. A shocking pink stole was knotted about a rough overcoat, and black rubber boots covered the feet.""
In the movie you get a glamorous woman in technicolor dreamcoat clothes who always smiles and has nothing meaninful to contribute to the story.

Darkness can only survive through energy and when we give into it then yes we give darkness power. But in order to weaken darkness we have to ignite our lights through removing the layers of the program that has been placed on us through societal ways.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;pyrocitor;"A Wrinkled Brow; A Waste of Time";4/10;"Mucking around with cinematic adaptations of the precious prose from audiences' childhoods is somewhat of a minefield - for every Lord of the Rings triumph, there's an insulting travesty such as ... well... The Hobbit. Tragically, there's much more than a whiff of the latter in Disney's big-budget shot at breathing life into author Madeleine L'Engle's metaphysical whimsy. Ava DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time is a bloated but sweet movie you desperately want to like, gosh darn it. Sadly, it's too unsalvageable to even defend as harmless children's entertainment - so cataclysmically off-base that, rather than rescue it from Camazotz, you'd probably go out of your way to maroon it there, and save everyone from the heartbreak of its existence. L'Engle's novel had a gentle otherworldliness in its whimsy, but the only thing 'otherworldly' in Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell's screenplay is that it reads like an extraterrestrial inhabitant clumsily trying to piece together how humans verbally communicate. The film drips with more grotesquely stale exposition than dialogue, with the unappetizing side order of characters reacting to the increasingly fantastic happenstances as if shot with tranquilizer darts, dopily shuffling from point to point without ever seemingly registering an emotional response. Fall into an immediate conversation about feelings with a boy you've never met? Already outlandish for a teenager. Travel across the universe with a passive-aggressive space-witch who eventually takes the form of a flying cabbage? Oh. Sure. Come face-to-face with the root of all unhappiness and evil in all multiverses? Meh. It almost defies belief that the director of the flooring, poignant Selma is capable of producing a film so shallow and emotionally stilted. It would normally play as charming to have a children's film bounce with the same episodic stream-of-consciousness of a child's storytelling, but DuVernay is never fully able to corral the playful lilt of L'Engle's gossamer, episodic plot. Instead, the film lurches from blandly dazzling planet to confusedly extraneous supporting character with nauseating, plodding incoherence. Loopy yogi Zach Galifianakis and charmingly threatening Michael Peña do their best to raise laughs with their awkwardly out-of-place cameos, but even they fail to distract from how flat the razzle-dazzle of each new alien landscape in between feels. The film's expensive-but-unsophisticated visual effects, are, at best, benignly underwhelming (and what little wonder is raised by their colourful panoramas is immediately extinguished by the unwanted musical accompaniment of an asinine pop remix). Similarly, the ludicrously kitschy costumes do nothing to dispel the aesthetic of tackiness (poor Oprah looks like she should be engaged in a ray gun battle with Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon). If this is what $100 million looks like, it's not money well spent. Things do pick up favourably upon our heroes' arrival at the forebodingly conformist alien hell-hole Camazotz. DuVernay excels at conjuring inventively creepy set pieces, some pushing the boundaries of what otherwise plays as a distinctly young children's film (perhaps a horror movie should be next on her docket?), and, briefly, the film is infused with the glimmer of actual stakes and emotional resonance. Naturally, it doesn't last long, losing steam with a stuttering dud of an ending, which takes all of the nonchalance of the (non)climax of L'Engle's novel, and drenches it with an uncomfortable excess of shouted sentiment (and if you thought the ending metaphysics of Interstellar were uncomfortable... hoo boy; just you wait), just in case the cloying moral hadn't quite sunk in yet. We almost relish the prospect of the children being tormented again as alternative. DuVernay attempts her own 'Wrinkle in Time' by fusing contemporary setting and sensibilities with the antiquated language and uncynical sentimentality of L'Engle's novel. Her intent, evidently, is to show how much our jaded, modern world could benefit from an infusion of more old-fashioned whimsy - which is pretty hard to argue with. Unfortunately, the pairing of quaintness and contemporary is a perennially dubious fit, the twain influences serving to best illustrate each other's worst qualities rather than complimenting each other (Charles Wallace delivering a chirpy, James Stewart-esq monologue attesting to Meg's inner greatness in the face of her post-feminist schoolyard bullies is one of the most cringeworthy movie moments of the past several years - but don't worry: it'll have plenty of company by the time the credits roll here). You can practically taste how driven DuVernay is to make A Wrinkle in Time a children's film with a strong pedagogical moral barometer, including commentary on abusive parents and eating disorders, but, sadly, her film is too much of a disjointed muddle for any real impactful content to stand out. Instead of elevated and inspired, audiences are, sadly, likely to emerge as far more cynical and hopeless than before. Even the film's impressive cast fail to elevate the overcooked, sinking ship of a film around them. Storm Reid feels like a fully authentic teenager (and is lackadaisically likeable in spite of that), but she's a tad too flat to sell her volcanic emotionality as a commanding presence - in short, more 'Meh' than 'Meg.' Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw easily steal the show, imbuing the film with its only dregs of emotion and charisma as her earnest scientist parents, but they're both too disappointingly underused to contribute all that much. As the trio of 'magical Mrs.,' Oprah, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, all feel simply uncomfortable, alternating unfunny banter with mawkish overacting and banal pep talks. Levi Miller is the dictionary definition of 'bland YA lead' as Meg's clumsily spontaneous love interest, while Deric McCabe is impressively adept at playing 'creepy child,' but is infuriatingly simpering as Meg's child genius brother. Time is a precious commodity in today's day and age. Unfortunately, Disney's latest doesn't so much Wrinkle as waste yours. Pundits may complain that 'they 'may not make 'em like they used to' - but, what we learn from A Wrinkle in Time is that, disappointingly, sometimes it's best not to try.  -4.5/10";9 April 2018

The book did not resonate with me. For whatever reason, it was not what I had expected and I put the book down for 33 years.At the start of this year I saw that Disney was making A Wrinkle in Time into a movie. I knew it was time to finish the job. I don't like to leave any book I start unfinished, and this was a chance to see if there really was anything interesting in that old book.I ordered a copy from Amazon, and in a few days I was reading it each night to my 11 and 12 year old boys. We finished the book just in time to catch the movie on its release weekend.I think the movie is fantastic.The movie brought the book to vibrant, dazzling life. What was rote back and forth dialogue between a small child and a celestial being, now became a supernatural event that opened up the universe to the earthbound adventurers.Yes there were differences between the book and the movie, but there always are. The changes save time, limit peripheral characters and in the case of the ending, give the movie more emotion and energy than the book's hurried last scene.The movie was made for a modern audience, updating setting, references and language to connect with today's children and adults.What makes the book and the movie great are the themes. Underlying the story are the ideas of perseverance, bravery, trust, family and most important of all, that love wins over fear. The movie captures the movies theme's perfectly, enhancing and amplifying them at just the right time and space.So why was the IMDB rating 3.7 when I looked on Sunday night? It has since climbed to 4.1, but that is still too low for a movie this good. Reading some of the user reviews, it was clear that the haters have come out in droves.Maybe some people simply don't like the movie. Having read the book, I certainly was in a better position to connect with the movie. But given that A Wrinkle in Time focus on interracial parents and their children, cast strong female characters that were part witch, part angel in the case of Oprah Winfrey, an all knowing demi-god, is it any surprise that there are people whose reflexive barriers prevented them from ever giving this children's movie a chance?Despite the overwhelmingly clear message of love, the haters had to lash out...and I know why.You see, the Black Thing has got them. They have been ensnared by IT and Central Intelligence, and they cannot help themselves. They watch a movie that describes the very thing that is the cause of their pain and suffering, along with the anecdote, but they are too blind to see.SPOILER ALERT
So I am writing this post to help you, the hater. You need to resist hate and the fear. You need to open your heart. You need to go back into that movie theater and realize you are about to watch a sad and bullied girl go on a journey across the universe to find the father she loves. She will be aided by angels, her future husband and her gifted little brother. She will have to be brave and fight in order to save her little brother from the clutches of evil. In the end she will discover that love conquers fear, and that she is strong and capable.If that doesn't make you happy and bring you joy, then maybe the Black Thing has its claws in you far deeper than any movie can rescue.";13 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;kjproulx;A Mediocre Outing For Disney;5/10;Everyone seems to be throwing shade on Disney for being too attached to franchises and not doing anything original. They are definitely a studio that recycles ideas and makes them into unique new things, so they are always worthy of applause, no matter how familiar one of their films may seem. I was very much looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time. I had no prior knowledge of its source material, so I was seeing it as an original film that was hitting theatres sometime soon. That time has now come, and although I'm something who tries to see the best in every film that I watch, there's no denying that this one just doesn't quite feel right. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, but here's why it fails to reach its potential on multiple occasions.After her father disappears and ends up somewhere distant in the universe, his daughter Meg is sent by three women on a quest through time and space to locate him. Accompanied by her younger brother Charles Wallace and newfound friend Clavin, the three of them embark on a strange journey across the universe. With unique visuals surround each and every scene and a fantastic performance by Storm Reid in the leading role, the epic scale, and emotional impact are truly what will win over the viewers. Aside from those elements, this is a fairly sloppy movie that tries a little too hard to be unique.Without ruining the film, it relies very heavily on the character of Charles Wallace to heighten certain aspects of the story. For that reason, the film suffers from a few laughable lines of dialogue, due to the fact that Deric McCabe may not have been the right kid to cast in this particular role. I was taken out of many dramatic moments, simply because I just wasn't buying into the way he was delivering his lines.On top of that, the three goddesses in Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey are present for a purpose, but they could've easily been excluded from the film once they bring the main characters to the places they need to be. They're quite annoying and simply unnecessary when it came to the story itself. Witherspoon was solid, but that's only because she had more things to do with her role than the others.The most frustrating part about this film is that Chris Pine is great in this movie and the conclusion of the third act felt earned and I found myself emotionally invested and caring about certain characters. The reason that aspect of the film is frustrating is that the film deviates too much from his character and it just feels like it drags quite a while before reaching him. That's a huge problem, especially when reflecting on the fact that the runtime is a mere 109 minutes.In the end, A Wrinkle in Time may have been a much better film with a few re-writes and about 20-30 minutes added on in order to expand the world a little more. The editing felt choppy at times, certain characters appear in places without explanation, and the solid visuals aren't enough to elevate the sloppy plot execution. Yes, there are a few great performances and the core story is worth watching, but there are too many problems surrounding that element to really send anyone out to see this in theatres. This is a neat and complex idea that would've worked as a much grander and elongated epic. Ava Duvernay is a fantastic director that tried a little too hard to impress here and I truly hate to have to admit that about this promising storyline. Overall, this is a pretty middle-of-the-road picture.;9 March 2018

Okay, so the trio sent to help the kids don't really know how to help them.

Boy falls off back or Reese monster, lands in a bunch of flowers they move into another dimension to meet some bloke who's going to train the young girl to be a warrior by believing in herself while balancing on some wood thing. Little brother turns into a demon. They end up on a planet where nothing is what it seems and you can't trust anyone. The three fairies leave them there as they haven't the power to stay.......AAAAAAARRRRREGGGGGHHHH

There's a scene where you hear the fathers voice guiding her closer to his location through her mind then when she finds him he's surprised to see her. He's in a room like something out of a music video having some kind of breakdown. No food. No bed. Nothing. Like he's trapped in purgatory.
Poor screenplay. Poor script. Poor effects. Plot holes everywhere with no explanation of the thing the mother and father discovered. Can't remember the name of it.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;cantstopgco;Sucks;3/10;I saw this movie a few months ago, so I don't fully remember it, but I remember it was an insanely boring and unworthwhile experience and, while not the worst movie I've seen (I've seen the Emoji Movie in full), is quite possibly the most frustrating. Let's start off with how unfaithful it is to the book it's based off of: Entire sections from the Wrinkle In Time book are cut out from this movie. For starters, instead of finding Meg's father by going into the Camazotz headquarters and having to fight the red-eyed man inside and Charles Wallace under his possession, the part of the movie on Camazotz is restrained to completely boring borderline filler. Eventually they reach what the movie calls the Camazotz headquarters but it's an empty room where Meg's father is just sitting up in another empty room connected by an invisible staircase. Another big change is that the planet Ixchel is completely removed from the movie despite being a major part of the book without any attempt to even replace it. Even more randomly it seems they changed the introduction and conclusion specifically to highlight Calvin as a love interest. Another issue that sinks the movie: The visuals do not live up to the book's descriptions. The beautiful creature described on Uriel literally looks like flying cabbage in the movie and Camazotz looks less like the madness described in the book and more like a generic small town neighborhood. Possibly a bigger issue than terrible illustration or terrible adaptation, however, is terrible pretentiousness. The movie as a whole has this attitude that it's woke and deep with the flashbacks of bad things happening on Earth and the semi-vague descriptions of IT that make the whole thing play out like the protagonists are on an ego trip. I had to stop here because I'm late for something but yeah this movie sucks.;13 October 2018

I was also thinking ""So many female actors? YAS! A message about self-confidence? YAS! An outcast, teen girl with glasses as a main character? HOW RELATABLE!"" Oh dear, no.
First off, I'm a huge fan of time/space travel and other sci-fi themes. I, also, have never read the original series, so my expectations were set at ""This will probably be a fun kid's movie."" Oh God if I had only known the cringe to come.
Everything seemed off. The acting: *main characters waiting for lost little brother after a HUGE FREAKING TORNADO STORM THING* *lost little brother finally arrives safe and sound* *reaction: oh, hey, there he is*.....WHAT? The ""romance"" (if you can call it that): *teen girl downplays her intelligence* *teen boy:""you have no idea how amazing you are, do you?""* *camera zooms in on teen boy trying REALLY hard to make a sexy, seductive face*......is he constipated?
I saw other reviewers saying ""It's a kid's movie, you have to see it as that."" I wouldn't let my kid watch this if I had one. Yeah, honey, just go with the first guy that's relatively nice to you. Your disinterest in him doesn't matter so long as he compliments your hair.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;boudica-of-inceni;I felt bad for the actors in this, poor reimagining of a great story;3/10;"One thing about the vast majority of movies and are either not well made or just plain bad usually is of no fault of the actors involved. The actors all did a great job and I refuse to fault them for this movie doing so badly. I think all of them did a great job and that needs to be said. However, when the story does not come together and the script is bad, and when, in this case, the book does not follow certain thing crucial to the story, then it seems that often times it can look like a bad performance on their part which is very unfair. I also wonder how much is on the editing room floor.I do think it's great when a story adapted from a book can be reimagined using more modern day situations and events that are more relatable if it's possible and this one should have been one of those. For instance, Calvin's dad being very demanding. We do not actually ""see"" his dad in the novel, we see his mother who is a worn out, bitter woman who is a bit abusive. But, the book seems to be missing some characters such as Meg and Charles Wallace twin brothers. Other things that were changed were things like who Meg was. She was a ""trouble maker"" meaning that she was assertive in a ""rage against the machines"" type of way. In this version, Meg seems more like a push over who cowers at things instead of ""fighting back."" I have read A Wrinkle in Time"" twice and Meg's dad was not gone for so long. Basically, the movie was missing half it's characters or a lot of them anyway.
Things happened very fast whereas the book and the previous 2003 version, the TV Movie, showed a longer passage of time. It felt very rushed, had little character development on a lot of the characters, had frayed ends in the story to the point where it just became annoying and unwatchable. I had a hard time following it and it felt like it was saying nothing with a whole lot. It will be interesting to see if an uncut version comes out, but it is still missing two important characters, the twin brothers, in the story.. It was oversimplified and should have been a longer movie.So, I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read any of Madeleine L'Engle's books about the Murray?O'Keefe family aka the Kairos series.";28 May 2018

So I expected to enjoy the film but I didn't really. I can see that most children (and probably me if I had watched it at about age 10) would love this film, but i would not recommend any adults watch this film unless you're watching it with your child. It's not like other Disney films that are timeless and you can watch them years after they came out as a 30 year old and you still love them. The dialogue and the plot are most certainly written for children, and as someone who is not a child it was sort of cringey and awkward to watch. It has a good overall message and theme that is really not subtle at all (hence why it's good for children), but just don't expect this to be the kind of Disney movie that anyone at any age can enjoy.;31 March 2018

The movie was way too short, missing some critical components from the book, which made it a completely different story.Spoiler alert... An example is the scene of the children playing outside their houses. This relevance goes completely unexplained as the next part of the book - the man in the 'Central Central Intelligence' - is a critical part of the explanation.Another part that was an issue for me, was the lead up to the final hero-winning-the-day bit. The book takes a few chapters to build up to this, which makes the final bit work well, the movies - straight to it with little to no build up.On a positive note, it was well filmed, great costumes and brilliant CGI. Acting was passable. If you have not read the book, it may be vaguely entertaining, but if you have read it... expect to be very disappointed.;4 November 2020

She's a capable actress, but I suspect that Oprah Winfrey is just so famous these days for being Oprah she'll never be able to submerse herself in any other role. You'll always be aware you're watching Oprah acting. Chris Pine is just tedious and it's not his fault. He just plays a tedious character. He should fire his agent. The lead character, Meg, is just annoying. On top of that, this film is saddled with a story that just gets weirder and weirder, bleaker and bleaker and is burdened with a soundtrack to match - it's excruciating; one of the worst I can remember.

I know I should attribute to malice what can easily be explained by stupidity, but in this case, it is far from easy.The only reason I rated it three stars (towards the funny end of the spectrum) is because of its inadvertent humor, best appreciated while drunk or stoned or part of Myst3k. So many scenes seem to hint to other materials: Star Trek, Dr. Who, Neverending Story. Or maybe it was just me trying to make sense of something completely random. A good description for this movie: white noise. A better one: pretty colored noise.";18 November 2018

It seemed that she was sniping, making rude comments, or judging the other characters harshly. This is not Mrs. Whatsit at all. I was willing to try and overlook the rest of the large integral parts of the book that were left out, or even the weird changes that were made that didn't make any sense, but to change a beloved character into someone I could not respect at all is just plain wrong.;28 October 2018

It's inspiring, good pacing, and the female lead is great. Kid me would give it 10 out of 10 and beg her parents to buy it when it came out on home video. She would dress up as one of the missuses for Halloween and invite friends over to watch the movie.
When I watch it with an adult's eye (and an adult who has read all the books and loves a wrinkle in time with a passion) I see a lot of flaws. CGI aside, and understanding that adaptations *have* to be different than the book, there is one MAJOR mistake (no spoilers but it has to do with the IT) and a number of more minor missteps. There are mild pacing issues and some characterization is just too too different from the source material (poor Calvin). Adult me would likely rate it a 2 or 3 out of 10. 
Therefore I decided to let my rating reflect my ambivalence. 5 out of 10 may not split the difference entirely between my two rating extremes, but I think it conveys how much I keep waffling over it.";8 May 2018

As a lifelong fan of the series, I was looking forward to the movie. It captured many of the big themes and small scenes, left out some things I think were important, but in no way deserves such a low rating on IMDB. Unfortunately, Calvin's character was pretty much gutted from the mathematical genius who has to hide his brilliance to remain a popular kid. I was sad that the rescue of CW was gutted as well. The decision to go back after being safe is what love is really all about.I will say that I was in a theatre full of children on Saturday and they were quiet and invested in the film.

The quotes was ridiculous, associating Einstein, inventors and Frida Kahlo with this was too much, even the dollar store gems on Oprah's forehead were crooked. Why was Oprah even in this film? she's not even a real actress, did she market this film? I could only assume it was her and her millions while trying to stand out in this film as some Goddess hovering over everyone else in her gigantic form.

Their father, a famous scientist, has been missing for four year and three mysterious women appear to help the children find him.If you're a person who likes dark, depressing movies, I'm going to go ahead and say skip this movie because one of the main themes about this film is love. It's like the book as well. One of the reasons this film is so great is it shows young girls that love can be a powerful thing. Storm Reid (who plays Meg) does a fantastic job, giving us a character who is relatable and admirable. Deric McCabe (Charles Wallace) also does a fantastic job. The casting in this film is phenomenal, giving us a fantastic cast and each actor delivers a wonderful performance. I honestly think this film did a great job of adapting the source material.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;graduatedan;A bloated and tone deaf adaptation;2/10;Madeline L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in time was asked about the first filmic iteration of her novel, a 2003 made for tv movie. She said she knew it was going to be bad- and that it was. If Madeline were with us today, I'd be willing to bet she'd really dislike this terrible new version of her fantasy. There are a number of reasons for the truly awful viewing experience this film turns out to be, prime among them the fatal miscasting of almost every character in the book. This is especially true of Charles Wallace and Meg, the main protagonists of the story. Important scenes from the book have been omitted and the film's leaden pacing all but obliterates the suspense that made the novel so memorable. What really sinks A Wrinkle in Time is the fact that the book's sense of wonder, it's raison d'etre, if you will, is missing. Instead, we're subjected to overblown special effects sequences, stunt casting and bad acting. The irony is that the 2003 film that Madeline disliked comes closer to the heart of her story than this stinker.;19 January 2021

It portrayed amazing visuals. And as far as the story is, it was good! One of the some of little problems from the movie was the acting and character development. Although you get development, you don't really care about the characters until later in the movie. The spirits didn't really explain themselves until the middle of the movie. Calvin doesn't get explained a whole lot. And the explanation of how and why Charles Wallas came in contact with Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which is never really explained. Now as far as acting goes, Oprah Winfrey (Mrs. Which) Reese Witherspoon (Mrs. Whatsit) and Mindy Kaling (Mrs. Who) did fantastic. Storm Reid (Meg), Deric McCabe (Charles Wallas), and Chris Pine (Mr. Murray) also did a great job. Levi Miller (Calvin) also did good but didn't express emotion into his character. Overall the acting was great.All in all, this was a good adaptation of a wonderful book. They already made an adaptation prior to this one in 2003. 7/10 Good Movie :)";11 March 2018

The special effects, locations and sets are gorgeous, the acting, while not seamless, is done very well by the kids in the film. But what sets it apart is why you should go and see it, like, NOW: it's based on a novel about girls' empowerment written over 50 years ago, it's directed by the first (yes! first!) African-American woman to direct a major-motion picture in Hollywood, there's a mixed-race family, a strong, scientist Mom, and a strong and smart girl hero. From what I can see, many of the reviews here (and on IMDB, etc.) seem to be thinly veiled and coded warnings to viewers about precisely those issues...many of the negative reviews are from the same people who gave all of the Harry Potter movies 10 stars, despite those movies' serious flaws. All the more reason to get your family down to the theater. Go see what real women do...and what real girls can do when they grow up. (Hint: they can save the world!);19 March 2018

I do remember the book being dark, so I was nervous when ava said it was a movie for children. THAT BOOK IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. (it is, but it's not. you know what I mean) I was very upset with some of the changes, not because i'm racist, but because SOMEBODY in the Murry family had to have the genius Murry genes passed on. in the book, that was Charles Wallace, but in the movie, he's adopted, so how do you explain his genius? it logistically makes no sense. there's also subplots I wont spoil that could have been put to better use STICKING CLOSER TO THE BOOK. I admit it, i'm a book purist. I go to a film to see the author's vision, not the director's. thankfully, this started to happen the 2nd half of the film. the movie got more faithful (and darker) halfway through. it's a beautiful movie and i'm glad I saw it in 3d, so that plus a great cast is why I give it a 6, but I don't need to tell you this movie is mostly a screw up.;19 March 2018

I don't understand why there are so many poor reviews for this movie. I thought it was lovely. The first half hour won me over and had me in tears. Like the Lord of the Rings, another favorite, the movie-makers decided to take out some things and add some new things. It's difficult to make a movie out of beautiful writing alone (such as any movie based on a Jane Austen novel - the more successful ones add more suspense and intrigue). And so, more action scenes were added (there are no real action scenes in the book). I'm no judge of acting. I just know what I like. I did miss Aunt Beast - I thought that section was important to the story because it made clear that Mr. Murray did not desert Charles Wallace, and it explained why it had to be Meg who needed to save him. I missed the earth-like feeling of Camizotz too, because it is a part that always gives me a strange surreal feeling when I read it - this is one of the places where they decided to add more special effects and action. I can't argue with that, and I thought ""It"" was done in a very interesting way. I loved the paper analogy to love folded over and hidden, and how it was carried through the story though it wasn't in the book - this is an interpretation, a useful device, that made it clear that love was the power that fought the darkness, and was the power that Meg had.";15 March 2018

I read the book, which is completely different from its adaptation, and I did not even care about the vast contrasts because the points depicted and values exercised were so brilliantly made. This movie does not deserves these ratings at all. It's not opinion, it's fact.;16 March 2018

You all look insane and you really need to grow up. This is a wonderful, unique, clever kids film that delivers something great for girls and boys alike. I took a group of several kids to see this and they all loved it.Even for those whose haven't read the book, the film has a fantastic cast of intriguing characters, a beautiful storyline, interesting scientific and magical themes, and of course truly stunning imagery.I am so glad Disney tried something new, and I am so glad my kids were able to experience this film.";20 March 2018

To me, however, this would be the only complaint that makes sense. It is visually stunning from start to finish, includes many well-represented moments from the novel, and is exactly what I had hoped it would be.At the moment, A Wrinkle in Time is on Netflix.

I also felt like the climax of the movie came all of the sudden. Boom, here it is, and then it is gone. This was a bit disappointing. A great movie overall to see with kids.

I felt Oprah channel what she has learned about life through her personal experiences through her character. Witherspoon's character and personality...definitely a mirror for Meg. I understood the quotes throughout the movie. I'm a Disney fan and always enjoy their movies. I've been taught if you listen long enough you will learn something new every day. Watching A Wrinkle in Time today proved that. This movie will reach the intended listener and audience it is designed to reach. I am one of them.

And you can stop reading my review and switch to another review, so that I wouldn't be wasting ur time.But if you are on an Awakening path, this one is for you. This movie is like a manual / a tutorial about our universe n energy and everything in life for generations to come and that's why I like it. I am a Lightworker and so are many. I don't usually see Disney movies but this Wrinkle in Time caught my eye when I heard Oprah's talk about Manifestations on an interview session of this movie. The interviewer in that session herself mentioned that this movie has awakening messages all over. Plus Oprah herself is wide Awake. So I wanted to see it.This movie has all you need to know about healing your wounds by facing them to see the light beyond fear and darkness (that are mere illusions to keep u in the dark). It also hints on the concept of oneness which is true and beautifully scripted. I liked this movie, a lot! It resonated with my awakened being to a T. It's literally the tutorial for life for the young ones and generations to come. This is an Awakening movie. And just keep your eyes on the lookout: this movie is soon going to see its daylight in the coming years as this mass awakening on earth is already happening and at a rapid pace. People are seeing the world with their third eye and getting out of the Matrix fast. This is The Movie for our current young ones and our future generations.Thanks Oprah, Reese, Mandy and Chris for being a part of it. This movie explains the Awakening process to the young ones beautifully.;5 December 2019

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;kbenko;I tried to have an open mind;6/10;"I went into this movie expecting to be frustrated and disappointed, but hoping to be wrong. I was frustrated and disappointed, but there were a few bright spots.Bright spots:The way Meg approached her father at the end was much more interesting than in the book. The eerie disturbingness of the bouncing-ball children was conveyed better in the movie than in the bookThe last tesseract was beautiful and cathartic.
Disappointments:There was not enough contrast between Charles Wallace and IT/Charles Wallace. It was like the difference between a 5yo in a good mood and a tired, cranky 5yo, not the difference between a loving but young genius and a child whose mind has been taken over by a planet-destroying source of evil.Dr. Mother Murray was written/acted as worried and scared most of the time. In the book she was so unflappable that her calm was practically science fiction in itself. That's what I wanted to see.Mrs. Whatsit was mean to Meg on more than one occasion. One of my favorite things about the Mrs. Ws is their frumpiness, that manages, for many people, to conceal their brilliant natures. I wish it had been possible to do that in the film. Instead, we had yet another conflation of beauty and goodness. :-(";12 March 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;clrogers-56482;Don't listen to the book purists!!;9/10;"Look, I get it. You love a book and you want to see it faithfully retold on film. But hating on this movie simply because it changed some details misses the bigger picture and fails to acknowledge the importance of the spirit of the book over strict adherence to the plot.First of all, the focus of the movie shifts from the relationship between Meg and Charles Wallace to Meg's journey of self discovery. I think this was a great shift, because I believe the book paints a very dated picture of what sibling relationships are like. I think the movie successfully communicates how deeply Charles Wallace and Meg care for each other while simultaneously showing Meg building self esteem and discovering who she is, and finding worth in that identity. Storm Reid was PHENOMENAL.Next, the ending. Oh god how grateful I am that they changed the ending. I was SO disappointed by that BS ""power of love"" and then it's over ending in the book! In the film, it felt more genuine and immediate-it felt like a fight for their lives. Yes, Meg does still save Charles Wallace with her love, but it's not that easy. It's intertwined with a discovery of love for herself as well as fighting for Charles Wallace.All I have to say about the Mrses is that they where phenomenal, and keep an ear out for a Hamilton reference at the end! Okay, and yes, they changed a lot. They took out the Aunt Beast scene. But was it that important of a scene? Personally I found Meg intolerable at this part of the book, and all they did on that planet was regroup and send Meg to get Charles Wallace. They folded the rescue of Charles Wallace into Meg refusing to tesser without him, and even set up the power of her will earlier in the movie. They also changed the nature of Camazot. Instead of a machine-like city with quotas and statistics and the highest rate of simultaneous actions, it was more a changing planet designed to trap them. At first I balked at this change, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the industrial setting from the book didn't really fit the atmosphere of this movie. Now, I'm not saying this movie was perfect. My biggest complaint was how they downplayed Charles Wallace's intelligence. He never even tried to fight the man with red eyes. He just immediately succumbed. I don't think they did a good job of communicating how special and gifted Charles Wallace is, and I get that they did that for Meg's character, but I wish they hadn't done it SO much.There's more I could say, but these are the main points I wanted to make. Please go into this movie with an open mind and heart. Please remember that this book was published in 1962 and it NEEDED updating for modern audiences. Please give it a fair chance!";14 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;Sherparsa;a Racial-ist if not racist movie?;5/10;"Https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/?ref_=nv_sr_1Sorry, even 5*** is too much but i gave it to this so-so fantasy / scifi movie mostly for the sake of the effort, story and the not so fab (yet likeable enough) CGI imagery ...also liked certain few scenes for their content plus choice of location resulting in some (albeit familiar and cliche') social commentary too though ...overall, i could say the rather sensitive subject matter of races (probably the world's 'biggest problem' in general and America's in particular) is toyed around with rather excessively in this movie although it tries to stay away from it directly and on the surface at least ... (in order to avoid 'suspicions' maybe!? yes, racial issues ARE tricky in America but is the media helping in eliminating them the way they truly could really, or are they worsening it even further? why, for example, America did eventually have an African Black prsident but not a Native one yet? not that i know of at least, has there been one?)dunno if others would agree with me on this but trying to encourage some minority races (again, in the 'police-state' America more than anywhere else, where the topic is 'critical' surely!) into liking science and 'falling' for it when pursuing higher education is in itself a GRAND issue in that country, where, again, education in general and higher education in particular, is not an easy thing for MOST people to begin with, which is due to high expenses and serious financial obstacles such as high-interest bank loans, not to mention 'lack of job security' after graduation, which is also probably the biggest downer for many American young when thinking about becoming a scientist or even a business professional or anything when they daydream about growing up and getting rich!that means no matter what race or minority (or even majority!) group you come from in the US of A, although entering schools is not difficult for anyone, but staying in them (and remaining a 'sane' person too!) is the most difficult, almost impossible part of the deal!that is why America's been so reliant on importing highly educated experts and specialists 'from other planets' rather than producing them 'here on Earth' for a long time now ... (much less to export them 'universally across other galaxies' too!)also, this is certainly a ladies movie i'd say ... director is a female, one of the writers also is, and at least one of the producers too ... not to mention some other females in key positions behind the scenes AS WELL AS in the story: The THREE WHICHes (of Universevil?) are female, the protagonist is a girl, and her scientist mother ... another female 'key figure' there too ...nothing wrong with that of course and i have always loved and strongly supported most female-made art of all kinds my entire boring life post maturity ...but, and again due to the reasons mentioned in previous paragraphs (the rather big and ALARMING shortage of highly specialist DOMESTIC physicians, industrialists, scientists and so on in America thus having to 'purchase' them from other countries) and trying to get minorities (perhaps African Americans more than others?) into, ''Think about it Meg, THAT not so attractive yet very smart teenage gal defending and saving her 'handsome White scientist' ignorant yet loving and hipster father could be YOU! Who knows, maybe a handsome nice White boy will also like you someday just as your White pa did your Black ma, you see!?''but when the proper grounds for breeding such a rare and valuable stock is not only unprepared, but almost entirely ruined and wasted thus unavailable, sending such sublime messages across to the likely candidates is rather like offering them a delicious dessert before the main course and reminding them right away that there's not going to be any meal later anyway, deal with it! (did the current POTUS who's willing to reduce and stop exporting jobs offshore sponsored this movie by any chance? ((NAAAHHH! this movie is pro-Obama openly and for obvious reasons!)) besides, the current POTUS has already sponsored offshore drilling for 'cheap oil' in some nice and clean US places already though, hasn't he?) :Dand those direct hints at cultural and artistic or scientific ""WARRIORS"" by quoting them (who, not surprisingly, come from all nations in the world, well, almost, including America!) as if we're browsing through those cliche' Facebook memes ... and eventually naming them one by one in the end as well (with the exception of many lesser-known yet more influential ones!) doesn't help much really, especially when coming out of the mouth of an overweight business minded super conservative tv and showbiz celebrity figure (and a likely POTUS candidate in the future as well) disguised as a liberal, who happens to be anything but a progressive- or scientific-minded persona really! (just check out her choice of a psychiatrist whot ended up running his own show later!)or maybe that was the idea after all: attracting the attentions of that rather large section of the American society that watches tv all day and night long and loves nearly anything amusing BUT science!?(bringing her giant presence down from the sky and making her look like a normal-size human ((albeit still covered in heavy makeup and fancy expensive dress)) which one of the young actors also confirmed, was a nice touch though! i liked that ...) ;-)long story short, i'm not saying this is a BAD movie; it's actually even worth watching (once only and no more!) and probably the text upon which this movie's been made is a good read after all, but my final conclusion is that it's too mature for the young addresses it was made for (was it?) while also too childish for the mature audience (ignorant 'scientist' parents 'Lost In Space' in particular) who're supposed to like and 'learn' a thing or two from it ...";22 October 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;alaynad;Disappointing;3/10;"I had read the book when I was in college and had watched the 2003 movie only to be disappointed. I was so hopeful that this remake would be good since now CG is way better but I was still so disappointed. The plot drags along so slowly only to cram in Meg's confrontation of The IT as an afterthought when the writers realized that they had to wrap it up. The movie leaves out so many important parts of the book like why Charles Wallace gets taken over by The IT and the whole part with Mrs. Beast after Meg, Calvin, and her father first leave Camazotz without Charles Wallace. That part is a crucial part for Meg's character development! It's why she is able to go back and save her brother from The IT by using her love for her brother instead of focusing on numbers to keep The IT out of her mind. They completely skip that part about The IT having the power to reach into and control/play with their minds so much too! Ugh. The movie does nothing to explain what is actually going on with the characters and focuses so much on love and trying too hard to get the message across with special effects that it just ends up being sloppily thrown together and waters down the message. They were trying WAY too hard.
I didn't give it the lowest rating only because I was comparing it to the 2003 movie and it has a lot of improvements visually compared to that one, and I appreciate the costumes and parts of the movie, plus my 5 year old likes it.";30 September 2018

Like the most laughable line was was the "" Flowers are the best gossipers of the universe line"" which is just as laughable as the first films "" These are glowworms they feed on laughter"" line. The costumes the characters wore in the middle movie were terrible to the point of even looking laughable. They pretty much butchered the characters as they were bland, and weren't anything at all like they were in the book period. They completely got rid of several important plot points like the ixchel part which was important in the book, and the whole movie felt rushed also with some plot points not even making sense to me either.About the only thing I can say that I sorta liked about the movie as I kinda liked what they did with IT, but that's about it; speaking of which they didn't even beat IT either in movie did they? Like they just sorta left it, and to me that's a plot hole as that basically means it's still a threat to earth as they didn't mentioned it died or anything either.Honestly all in all I feel like I wasted money watching this movie, and felt like I should've listened to the reviews on this site instead of seeing it; I don't even consider this movie even good enough to get at a bargain bin because it was so bad.So In a way I kinda recommend the older movie more, but not much as even that movie wasn't that good; however it's still better than this movie by a lot honestly.";16 July 2018

It does get quite creepy and a little sinister. For some older crowds, it will be a snooze-fest And for some, an OK film worth seeing once. Younger kids will like it. Teens will hate it. The film does get weird at times and it seems unsure of itself. Some parts are Life-time channel sap. Others, borderline Burton. Some scenes cringe-worthy. Others pretty cool.

Maybe this review might be helpful to others out there who are like me:Plot: 3.5/10
Cinematography: 4/10
Visuals: 7/10
Actors: 7/10
Overall: 3/10I watched the movie almost nearly blindfolded. All I checked out was the cast and the plot summary. The pace of the movie felt slow. The actors were great on their own (except Calvin which I'll explain later), as well as the visuals but the plot was too cliche and predictable ... which made the movie an overall ""bore"" to watch. 
But it wasn't that boring though, given a lil thanks to the visuals. That's how I felt anyway, otherwise I would have yawn multiples times throughout the movie; but I didn't.Anyway, good acting came from the star actors, especially lil Charles Wallace (played by Deric McCabe). But one main character felt a bit odd to watch and that is Calvin (played by Levi Miller). Dude looks and sounds like he's high/drugged on some love spell. And I'm not sure if that's intentional or not but I did not feel any emotional depth in character. Like he's just there for the sake of being there. And the plot... ayy, nothing much to say about it other than it being absolutely predictable. Especially with the whole ""there is light in darkness"" concept. So yes, just like most of the folks here have said: ""very poor script"". 
And it's such a shame really because I felt there IS potential to bring out that hidden awesomeness in it---I wondered why the advertising for this movie was not that happening. Well, that's a good thing I guess because if it were then the hit from critics would be a lil more painful.";6 May 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;benc1-1;Wow...just...wow;2/10;"This was a major dissapointment. I'm a fan of Ava DuVernay as a filmmaker, and I was looking forward to see what she would do with a big budget fantasy film. I'm not sure what happened here, but it's just a big mess with few good things in it. So the positives; this film has a wonderful message about self confidence which kids should hear. Oprah was something to behold, she didn't do much but she definitely had an interesting prescense on screen. And Storm Reid did a great job with what she was given, I think she has a bright future. Ok now the bad. This movie makes no sense, and it asks you to just start accepting all this crazy shit happening without earning it. Some things just happen for no reason and they're so bizarre and jarring. The acting from all the others mentioned is either real bad or just too much. Reese Witherspoon is just weird and over the top, and she gets rather annoying real quick. Mindy Kaling did her best with what she was given I suppose, but it wasn't much, and she speaks in quotes, which I guess could be cool if she didn't say who said it right after, and then she just speaks normally halfway through. Levi Miller plays the typical sidekick love interest that's typically given to women, so ok we can let that one slide, but he literally is there for no reason. Even when we're introduced to him, right before the magic stuff starts happening btw, they ask him why he's there and he says he doesn't know, he just felt like he was supposed to, and they never explain that, it's so weird and lazy. Now Deric McCabe...Oh boyI don't want to rag on this kid because he's young and inexperienced so I'm sure his performances will improve, but holy crap this kid got on my nerves. His delivery of this already pretty bad dialogue is just painful. And for some reason he's just aware of all the magic stuff from the beginning and it never explains that. Then they turn him into the bad guy at the end, so now he's trying to deliver this typical villain dialogue with his squeaky childish voice and it just comes across as cringy. All of the other actors do a good job with the very little they had. Overall I really disliked this film and contemplated walking out several times. The only reason I didn't was because I thought it could in some way redeem itself, but it never did. I could see your kids really enjoying this movie, but you shouldn't expect to.";12 April 2018

I like Harry Potter movies but this particular movie made no sense to me. I think there was some sort of well meaning message but the environment and script failed to bring that moral up to par.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;cliftonofun;A beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless;3/10;"Having recently re-read this book with my family (in anticipation of the film), I can tell you that L'Engle's classic is fondly remembered but hardly perfect. This film managed to channel some of the best parts of the book - a unique protagonist, an imaginative and beautiful universe, some fun science connections. That said, it also channeled (and magnified) all the messiness too. A somewhat garbled plot became completely disjointed. The 3 mrs. characters just plain never worked, spending every moment either explaining things or making stale jokes. An ominous evil force became laughably cliche fairly quickly. And most importantly, every single theme was beaten like a dead horse. It felt like a very special episode of ""A Wrinkle in Time."" I love DuVernay's ambition, but I had hoped for better than the most expensive and well-done after school special of all time. Sadly, that's what this was.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;greyapplefilms;Good Cinematography, OK VFX, and the WORST screenplay since 'The Room';2/10;I'm going to be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I went into this film. I had heard from my friends that it was bad, and I thought it wasn't going to be worth my time (hence the 3/10 imdb rating). And oh man - I was right!The film starts out - - - wait - I can't even remember. I'm not joking - I literally cannot remember how this movie started!There were some things about this movie that I did actually enjoy. Being a cinematographer myself, I try to look out for films that go above and beyond, and are creative in this field. And this film didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed most of the shots. I thought they expressed a good visual metaphor, that looked good on screen.I also liked the costumes and makeup. I know there probably won't be any oscar buzz around these categories, but I thought they were very well done, and got the message across.Now, lets get into the---other things about this movie. Although in some scenes good, I thought the visual effects in this film were surpassingly mediocre. I mean - It's not 'Justice League' bad, but there were times were the amateur-ness distracted from the story.I also think the acting was also very amateur. Now - I love Opra. She's great. But there was something about this performance which really made me wonder - 'Wait - that's OPRA??!!? Wasn't she a good actor once?' Storm Reid was OK. I think she has a lot of potential - and this movie just wasn't her time to show it. I HATED Calvin. I thought he was a totally unrealistic portrayed teenager that does not and will never exist in the world of teenagers.Now, this review has already gone way to long. But there is one last subject in which I would like to touch on. That's the screenplay. WOW. I had no Idea I screenplay could be this bad. I mean - this is almost 'The Room' bad. I haven't read the book, but my friends who have, have told me that a 30 page-longer section (THE CLIMAX) was entirely left out of the movie. I thought the dialogue in most places was cheesy, awkward - and just flat out WEIRD. NOBODY Meg or Calvin's age would EVER say these lines. I almost feel bad for all these actors. ALL of them have great potential, but they were submerged to a terrible screenplay, and that's why I think 'A Wrinkle In Time' is such a bad movie.;28 March 2018

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;sgordon2011;Not great, but also not as terrible as they'd let you think;5/10;"So let's get the good stuff out there: the visuals are pretty great. I loved the costumes of the Mrses, Nobody, and I dug Zach Galifianakis as Happy Balance. I liked the diversity of the cast, as it didn't seem to make much a difference either way, which is refreshing. I thought much of the cinematography was well done and quite beautiful. Now for the faults: like most people who have seen this film, the plot is severely lacking. I understand that they're going to find Meg's father, but that is clearly the McGuffin here. Though it's role as the McGuffin is largely undercut by the fact that Meg's father's disappearance is supposed to be the foundation for her despair; so the fact that her search for her father doesn't really matter much means that when they do find him, I don't particularly care. I mean, sure, the reunion itself is emotional, but as far as what it means for Meg as a whole person, it doesn't seem to matter at the bottom line. And I think that's a lot of the problem with this movie-much of the emotion is forced and hollow, with the film telling you how you should feel rather than allowing you to feel it. For example, Calvin just suddenly appears on the street with Meg and Charles Wallace and just stares at Meg and compliments her hair. It's incredibly awkward. I also don't understand why Meg is so important. It's made clear that she's smart, like her parents, but not an oddball savant like Charles Wallace. Yet the Mrses (Mrs. Which, specifically) is convinced that only Meg can save the universe from the Darkness. But why? And besides, if the Darkness is pure evil, why is it not a more powerful force? Why is there no dark, tentacle cloud over Earth? Why does it just manifest as jealousy or abuse in humans? I'm sure this is probably explained in the book, but to be frank, I don't remember much about the book when my fifth grade class read it. There are a lot of questions about the universe that are glossed over or brushed aside and it weakens the movie as a whole. So aside from convoluted story and plot (which I can put squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriters) the pacing also feels off. We spent a good 15 minutes of run time on a flower planet, that while quite pretty, doesn't lead us to much, other than Mrs. Whatsit deciding they need to see a Seer (Happy Balance) to find their father. Why not do this in the first place? They waisted 15 minutes of the movie on a flight sequence that had very little to do with the plot or story at the end of the day. And it's instances like this that make the 1hr, 49min run time feel heavily bloated. I sat through Wall-E (slightly over 2hrs) and the time flew by. By the time Meg finally has her Boss Battle with IT, I was ready to head out. They spend the first 45mins of the movie setting up the characters, but none of it feels particularly necessary. If Act I had been shortened into 20 minutes, it would have left more time for them to explore more of the Universe on the way to finding Meg and Charles Wallace's father. Or they could have just cut it down by 20mins and have been fine. I have to say, people are railing on this movie, and it's really NOT that bad. It's pretty heavy subject matter for kids (some pretty heady ideas being tossed around) but if you think your kid will sit through it, then I think it's worth a watch. I wouldn't spend $15 on it, but $5-$8 sure. I also have to say, hating on the acting is a bit unfair. For the Mrses, Nobody, and Happy Balance, they are beings who are choosing human forms so that the kids can relate to them. They can be whatever they want to be. To expect them to be emotionally human as well is unfair, thus I believe that the irritation one might feel with the acting stems from that. I'm of the opinion that it was a directorial choice and should be noted as such. In conclusion: an OK movie. Not great, but not the worst movie I've ever seen.";25 March 2018

 Sadly it didn't live up to the hype. My kids and I found it confusing at times as the plot jumped around with no real explanation. There were some beautiful visuals and all the cast acted well especially Meg played by Storm Reid.
 It's a shame because the moral of the story was strong but there was no structure and it just missed something whether it be a little comedy to lighten the darkness or more time spent on the characters and knowing them better.

A WRINKLE IN TIME contained way too many static scenes showing nearly nothing on the screen, as the characters waxed philosophical with seemingly endless Yakkity-Yakking. Even the recent feature MONSTER TRUCKS contained more consistent action, and came off as much better plotted. Considering that the source material for A WRINKLE IN TIME is alleged to be a children's classic science fiction novel, as well as the fact that this movie was promoted as having an A-List cast, most theater goers surely bought tickets with the expectation that they would be blessed with something more stunning, provocative, and ""snore-proof"" than just something at the level of another NINJA TURTLE offering. But rather than spending the pages necessary to pick apart the plot, performances, dialog, and effects of A WRINKLE IN TIME, perhaps it would be more constructive to focus on the ONE good thing about this exercise in how NOT to win friends, or influence people. That would be the portion of the movie in which--thanks to the Miracle of CGI--America's favorite traffic cop Sasser turns into a flying head of lettuce (though it would be nicer if we'd see more of her as she changes).";13 March 2018

They're different animals.;9/10;"I read the book a long time ago as a child, and then again as a teen, then again as an adult, and again as an older adult. It has always stuck with me and is a favorite of mine. It's a feel-good book, with classic elements of Light vs Dark, Good vs Evil, etc. It relates to kids who are feeling bullied or worn down by social problems, awkwardness in the teens, adults who make mistakes, and feels like a very empowering book to young adults who just want to have an adventure, and fight the good fight on their own.The movie also accomplishes that. It takes a group of kids and young adults and sends them across the galaxy on a mission to save Meg's father. It has all of the elements of a grand adventure, with gorgeous scenery, magical moments, and an ominous, dark presence to fight.I think what people are having trouble with, especial die-hard fans of AWIT, is that most of the book is centered around Meg and her internal dialogues. Her POV is very heavily personal-experience driven, and that's very hard to do visually. For instance, Meg doesn't like tesseracting in the books, because her body goes numb, and it feels like her entire body has been asleep. Coming out of the tesseract is the reverse of that process. So...how do you *show* that in a film? You can't. But the image in people's heads who have read book think they have ways to portray that sort of thing, but it's only relevant to themselves. And when they don't see it on the big screen, I think they get a little angsty and disappointed. I was not disappointed, and I understand a lot of the choices they had to make to bring such a book to the screen. Some wishes for the movie:
The Aunt Beast sequence I feel would have been very important. It was a game-changer that would have given the audience a moment to see Meg turn herself around. I think the trauma and recovery would have been a good sequence to have. I think Meg's sudden self-empowerment is a bit too sudden.The ending fight in the giant...brain?...of IT felt over too fast. The book does it masterfully with a lot of buildup to Meg's sudden realization of the weapon she has that IT does not. I think skipping that important point damaged the ending, and her screams of ""I love you!"" lost a bit of their edge. And I really loved the line in the book about ""She could stand there, and she could love Charles Wallace."" I wish they had incorporated that somehow, because it always brings me a smile at that turning point. I don't think they visually gave her that realization and turning point. They just focused on her faults and then love, and then suddenly Charles Wallace was free.Central Central intelligence was tossed in there, but was never really explained as to what it meant. I think either an entire removal of the concept, or an explanation would have been better than just a throwaway line for the fans.Man With the Red Eyes wasn't nearly as menacing enough. Too jolly, not enough bite.More emphasis on the mind-control that was happening with IT. The heart-beating rhythm wasn't emphasized enough.In the prison room, I feel Calvin was underutilized. He was essential to distracting Charles Wallace, so that Meg could use Mrs. Who's glasses to get inside the prison in the book. I wished they had had a better confrontation between Calvin and Charles Wallace, the kind of mental battle I thought would have spiced up that scene a bit more.I gave it 9 stars due to the wishes, but I thought it was a great movie.";26 June 2018

I don't know the lead actress playing the heroine, but she spends the whole movie with one expression - blank staring.

Even when there is a group of them together it's as if they are delivering lines in an an animation voice studio and they are not actually present or relating to each other. At one point the young brother reappears after being separated and there is zero reaction. The whole film is like that. There are one or two good visual moments, like the sinister children bouncing balls and their Stepford mothers, but otherwise no. It doesn't even have any scientific element to give it some credence.

It shows light/love is the only way to drive out darkness. It always shows the importance of persevering and having hope. This isn't my favorite movie, but it is pretty close.
The costumes were super good, and I loveeeeeed the various hairstyles. It was nice to see a family with curly hair (majority of black and biracial people have curly hair), because straight hair has been the norm until now. It was nice to see actors being able to show a bit of themselves in their characters.

Those that are don't translate well and are boring as heck. I can think of only one that I really enjoyed in the theater and that was due to the actors and writing. 
That said, this movie is more designed for ages 6+ and up. It is imagination inspiring. 
The cast of characters have excellent actors behind them. The cinematography is fabulous. The wardrobe is beautiful. The idea behind this is thought provoking. The end gets a little much for a child under the age of 6-7. That's why I say it best suited for that age and up. Will you be disappointed if you expect it go rigidly by the book? Absolutely. 
Be open-minded.

As a lifelong fan of the Madeleine L'Engle series, there were some things missing from the movie that disappointed me. But overall it is a pretty good adaptation.Yes, there might be a little too much clunky CGI but I thought all of the acting was very good. Meg was very good, with all of her wonderful faults. Charles Wallace was not as developed as I would have liked, but knowing the story, that was OK. (One of those missing scenes where Meg confronts her father and all the ways they try to break CW away from the IT should have been in there...)I will admit that would actually give the movie a 7 or so, but I rated it higher because I fear that MANY of the reviews are racially motivated and thereby bringing the overall score down.

Tron: Legacy, John Carter, and Tomorrowland were all flops that were met with a mix reaction. A Wrinkle in Time follows that trajectory and is particularly hated by fans of the novel. It was a such a flop that it didn't get a Blu-ray release in the UK and in some countries not even a theatrical release.I have not read the novel so I can only the film on its own merits. It is not deserving of a weak 4.2 on IMDB and it should be somewhere in the 6 range. The film was a visual spectacle with strong CGI and bright colours. It film itself was basically a Doctor Who style fantasy and is it possibly why I'm not that hostile to the film.However, the film shouldn't have centred itself around a child actor who well, couldn't act and Mindy Kaling was irritating speaking in quotes.;16 May 2019

A Wrinkle in Time is a bonkers film full a of surreal moments throughout. It is actually quite dark at times with some weird imaginations but we've seen this so many times before with films like Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately it never lives up to those films. The characters are dull, the direction is often sloppy, the pace is sometimes slow and the whole structure just feels muddled. It touches on topics like embracing your faults but it mostly fails in its execution. With dated special effects, some lousy makeup and wooden acting it just doesn't do enough to class as a good movie. It's a missed opportunity for Disney.;9 July 2018

The story was easy to follow on a young adult level. The messages/life revelations were all positive.
Parents need to look at the movie trailers more to realize that just because Disney was part of the movie's production companies, this is not a story for children, oh say under 8 or so. It will not hold their attention, of course this is strictly my opinion.";8 June 2018

The cinematography was beautiful; they make great use of CGI to depict the alien worlds, while still maintaining the realness of the main characters. I also thought the pacing was good. I was worried it was going to move too slow, but it ended up moving slow in the parts where it should and moving fast where it shouldn't.I liked the unconventional cast, though maybe Oprah didn't need to be in there. In the book Meg is supposed to be awkward, so people who are saying she can't act are just misunderstanding how she's supposed to be acting. The story is about embracing your faults and figuring out a way to use them to succeed in life; it wouldn't have worked to have Meg be swashbuckling.The main difference between the movie and the book is in the movie IT is actively trying to get them, whereas in the book IT is much more passive.

It's true that it stumbles a bit in certain aspects of screenwriting and filmmaking, but so do many films we call ""great"".

It also delivers a brilliant performance by none other than 9 year old Deric McCabe (and it isn't even worth mentioning how great Oprah Winfrey is in the movie).
I believe this wave of bad reviews is given to the fact that people read them before watching the movie, and therefore dislike it even before giving it a chance.

This is a Disney movie that is based on a 2003 book, written by Madeleine L'Engle. I have not read the book-and am probably not the target audience-but I thought the movie looked great and had a good story about bullying and having family to depend on, although it was a little confusing at times. Storm plays the daughter of Chris, a brilliant man that is working on a new form of space travel. It uses what they call tesseracts, sort of like teleporting from one place to another. One day, Chris disappears and no one has a clue-I guess they weren't paying attention to what he was studying. About 4 years later, Storm gets a visit from Reese, who tells her that she knows how to find Storm's father. Reese is one of a trio, including Mindy and Oprah, and they all have weird names, like Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. The effects are great but sometimes, it gets a little confusing as to what is going on.
It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements and some peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guess if you are a fan of the book, you might enjoy it more than I did. It would be a good rental, just for the scenery.";10 March 2018

It has some serious flaws, but it's not as bad as the reviews make out. It's enjoyable and interesting to watch, with largely good effects and performances by the actors. The reason I give it a lukewarm 5/10 is because of a key failure in the story.
The key message of the film is taken direct from the book: the power of love and family. It's a message everyone can agree on. But the story inexplicably fails to honor the theme in ways that lost the plot for me.
One of the key instructions for the children from the Weird Sisters was to stay together. The kids are on their own in the realm of evil and it's good advice, but the first thing that happens is they split up. Not only do Meg and Calvin lose young Charles Wallace, they don't even seem to notice he's gone. When he suddenly reappears with no explanation they don't even seem surprised.
It's a poorly constructed scene that broke the spell, but it wasn't unique. The people that they love suddenly disappear and no one seems to notice. They suddenly reappear and everyone just blithely trudges onward. It really undermines the story and the message.
That said, there is still plenty to enjoy. Read the book to get a measure of how much better it could have been.";12 November 2020

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;imdave-1;Don't bother.;2/10;"(Maybe spoilers, but you knew how it was going to end anyway.)This movie is about a misunderstood girl, who is bullied at school by some mean girls, and her father who somehow goes away to somewhere and for some reason some women come from somewhere and kinda help her and her brother find him. Kinda. Actually, they don't really help much at all. And for some reason they're joined by a boy from school that she doesn't seem to know very well. He does nothing. Mostly stand around watching her do stuff.After the movie ended I had SO many questions. Where did they go? Another planet? Another Universe? Another time? How did they get there? Something to do with frequencies apparently. Where did the women come from? The same universe her father was in? Apparently the women somehow help people, I guess. Kinda. Why did the women wait so long to help her?There's lots of visual candy and little kids will probably like that. But there's lots of nothing as well. Also lots of vague warnings and such and confusing things that are never explained and nobody seems to care. They say things like ""where are we?"" ""Were on such and such. ""OK"". No, it's not OK. Where is that? Is it a planet? Is it in our galaxy? Universe? We'll never know.The performances are pretty bland. Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon seem to be going a bit overboard to make up for everyone else just standing around talking.It was hard to really care about these characters. The movie wanted you to care about them without really giving you a reason to.I haven't read the books, so hopefully they explain things better than this movie did and if you've read them it makes more sense.Oh.

It didn't have any sense from time to time. And also those kids, exept Charles Wallace were dumb. Like for real dumb. The girl got so many leads on what to do and she wasn't able to figure that out. She went to another world and didn't wanted to start belive that she can do stuff. Her brother who had funny name was the one who understand the world and how it works. But still. SHE DIDN'T GO WITH THE FLOW ! And also i didn't find the reason for the Pan guy ( Calvin ) to be in the movie. He looked like he was high all the time.
Casting:
Storm Reid - Meg ( pretty decent job )
Oprah - I know that she has a nice voice and it really suits her character but damn, she had some really bad delivery.
Reese - I don't like this actress so i don't want to talk about her performance
Mindy - Why on earth did they casted her ? It didn't felted like all of these three actresses ( Oprah , Reese and MIndy ) were suitable for these characters. And also i'm againts about changing the race of the characters.
Levi Miller - Calvin : he tried ( bad script can make you look bad )
Deric - Charles : good job kid !
Chris Pine : He did the best he can.
Gugu Mbatha-Raw - She was good too.
Okay. So now the reason why i gave this movie 4 stars. I liked the music and the amazing world it showed to me. But I wanted to see more of that first planet. Or planets like that.

And towards the end, when Dr. Murrey could teleport his own way home. How could he do it on his own and why didn't he do it before to save himself? Lovely movie however I do struggle trying to make sense of it.;14 July 2018

From what I have I heard the book is really good when I went to the movie it was not as good as I heard the book was. I read part of the book and the included just a portion of that. It is probably one of my least favorite movies.;29 June 2018

It was very predictable movie you know what was going to happen the whole time. They used too much CGI which made it look fake at times. This is one of the worst Disney remakes I have ever seen. Some of it was really good and some was not. The movie was also rushed.;12 March 2018
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/reviews?ref_=tt_urv;playground_swing;Not as bad as the other reviews say;6/10;"While the other reviews accurately point out the loose-ended plot, poor acting, and unevenness of story movement that keep this from being a very good movie -- all these problems can't stop a good story from being entertaining. I had not read the book, so maybe that helped me like the movie. Also, I read the bad reviews before I went, so my expectations were low. Oprah's costume was distracting and fairly ridiculous, and the characters were cardboard representations of stereotypes. But regardless of the fact that the characters were flat and undeveloped, the theme of the story and some of the effects were enough to make this better than your standard ""after school special"" juvenile borefest. While this movie is not a great multi-star movie, it's worth a solid six.";11 March 2018
