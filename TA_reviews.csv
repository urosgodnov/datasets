Bathroom was clean, nice, with marble.WiFi was free.Stuff was very friendly, professional, and helpful. It seems they enjoy their work. Check in and out were quick and without any problems. I have only breakfast. It was great- a lot of choice, delicious food. Cook made fresh waffles and pancakes. There was also food for people who have diabetes. They also have their one wine cellar. There was nothing to complain. I think it deserve 5*."
25.03.2015,5,"Amazing hotel! Very clean, modern, excellent service, spa and pool! Rooms are super big, with a big and clean bathroom! Wifi connection works very well! Just the breakfast could be a bit better...moreover I've found a fantastic offer and I've paid for 1 night just 70 €!!!!"
14.03.2015,5,"Rooms are great, very well equiped, confortable bed, service is very good, food is very good. I had also an amazing view from balcony. I had a pleasant stay there aldought it was December and not much to do"
6.02.2015,5,"We had a short stay at Kempinski palace Portorož and it was excelent! Delux room was great, breakfast to die for and spa experience was fabulous! Reception staff is kind and welcoming, valet service efficient. The best hotel in Slovenia! We will be back!"
4.02.2015,5,"Beautiful hotel, great relaxing atmosphere in the piano bar. Breakfast was amazing and the prosecco added to that luxury feeling. The room was clean and comfortable. We had one night in this hotel but we could have stayed longer. Value for money!"
2.01.2015,3,"The hotel had nice rooms. We had a sea view room. There was noise (music) from the nearby cafe or a discotheque until quite late. No response from the hotel when we complained about it.The pool has sea water, which is nice. The saunas are not bad as well.The breakfast was ok.The service was hit and miss, even though it was clear that people were trying. No desire to return albeit for visiting nearby Trieste, Croatia and Slovenia are probably better options esp. off-peak season. Expensive parking."
26.12.2014,5,"Stayed with my wife and two young children in September on a 10 week tour of Europe. Modern hotel with very good facilities. Rooms were spacious and modern. I would probably call it a business hotel as it has large conference facilities, etc., which could mean it might get rather crowded, but when we were there it was fully booked and it did not feel crowded. Good spa with nice indoor and outdoor pool. Good location in the middle of Portoroz and just a 5 minute drive from beautiful Piran. We stayed here instead of Piran because we wanted the full set of amenities. We felt it was good value for a business 5 star hotel. The one negative was the large breakfast room which was a rather manic and crowded."
3.12.2014,5,"We stayed in Portoroz in October with family. The hotel has a modern and a classical part, we stayed in the modern part, 3rd floor, partial seaview, big balcony. Well, this is a 5 star Kempinski, so we were absolutely satisfied with the room and everything. Didn't try the outside pool, because it was cold or closed at this time of the year. Pool area and spa is nothing special for me. Breakfast in the ballroom is very nice, looking at the garden area, a big plus for the breakfast till noon. Parking fee is a little expensive. Staff was helpful. The location is fantastic, Portoroz & Piran are beautiful, I loved the seaside, even though we were out of season, so didn't swim in the sea."
26.11.2014,5,"We will return to this magnificent palace with an amazing SPA ...we loved breakfast until 12 in the amazing Crystall Hall as well as our deluxe room on the top floor with delightful sea view.Very affordable Kempinski to return to, friendly and professional staff"
25.11.2014,5,"nothing else to say just perfect. reception and concierge amazing, restaurant and bar very good, room and the hotel in general 5*. The concierge organized us a hunting within 15 min drive from the hotel an dit was realy great!"
24.11.2014,5,"Spent a week in Portorose in Kepminski for business. Price was excellent due to low season including breakfast. I enjoyed mostly breakfast in the spectacular ballroom. The quality and variety of breakfast was impressive, many local products. Staff was super friendly and detail oriented. My room was superior, garden view with a balcony, spacious and modern. Bed was extreemly comfortable. The only negative is the indoor pool, although spacious the water was very cold. Also selection of food in the bar was scarse. I will return to this hotel."
20.11.2014,5,"Quick business stay here for two days. I emailed the hotel and they arranged transportation for me to and from Trieste, Italy. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Rooms were nice - well appointed with a comfortable bed and pillows.Breakfast was good, with an excellent variety. Had some drinks and snacks in the bar, and the staff was great and friendly. Gave me a taste of the local liquor and didn't charge me. Quite nice!Only nit was that checkout can be tough if there is a group there. They have desks over a typical counter, so it takes longer. Plan accordingly if you are with a group."
29.10.2014,5,I stayed over a weekend in the hotel. The hotel itself is great. I had a room without seaview but looked into the small hills. The spa area is great I took a massage which was great but with around 90€ quite expensive. Also the bar is very nice but cocktails are quite expensive. All in all a great hotel not cheap but the money is well spent
14.10.2014,4,The rooms and the bathroom were very clean and nice ! The staff were very friendly and helpful ! Breakfast was good only aity the coffee was always cold ! Breakfast was served in a beautiful casle ballroom .
14.10.2014,5,"Visited this hotel for a spcific purpose, a day of total break in low season. Could not have made a better choice, you feel spoiled and relaxed. Check in was quick, by an experienced and very professional lady - must have been a senior staff. Useful and gentle without overdoing it - just perfect. Overall excellent concierge and reception staff. Spent 2 days at the pool, fantastic. My only concern is here - service at the pool is sporadic, almost absent and not very helpful - did not help with towels and I had to convince them to call the reception for assistance since they could not help. My praise is for the cleaning lady at the pool who tried her best to assist even if it was not her duty, while the pool guy was a bit lost.The room was nice with an extremely comfortable bed. Breakfast is simply excellent and enjoyable on the terrace overlooking the beautiful garden - i would have expected warm dishes prepared on the spot - which were not available. If you are in Portoroz dont look for anything else, and enjoy this hotel."
9.10.2014,5,"I've stayed at the Kempinski for 6 nights during September, and it was absolutely terrific!From an enormous number of e-mails to the wonderful concierge Kristijan, to the moment of checking in with lovely Cramen and the efficient Peter from Bell boys, everything went fluently.The hotel is a classic modern design, rooms are extremely comfortable and clean.Breakfast was superb! And the stuff always knew all of my favorite dishes and coffee.The spa was amazing, I had two treatments with a wonderful female therapist.Pool and other facilities are great as well.I felt very welcome every time I walked inside of the hotel. The stuff is fantastic!!I would like to thank the great staff and especially: Peter, Kristijan, Carmen, Liliana and Daniel for being so kind and helpful.All of the above are a credit to the Hotel, they portrays the epitome of real excellent customer service. Always smiling and welcoming every time of the stressful day.Thank you Kempinski for a beautiful vacation. I am sure I'll be back!Linoy"
9.10.2014,5,"My husband and I were blown away by this beautiful hotel and wish we could have stayed much longer than our two nights. Upon our arrival, the hotel set up a lovely display of rose petals on our bed (this was one stop on a 3 week honeymoon in Europe) as shown in my pictures. The staff and bellmen were some of the friendliest and most helpful hotel employees that we have come across in all of our travels. Great bedroom and balcony with a view, excellent location, great gym/spa/pool, and fabulous, fabulous brunch - which was included with our stay! We felt so comfortable and relaxed in Portoroz, and will be recommending this little gem of a town, along with the Kempinski, to anyone traveling in this area! This hotel provided the ultimate relaxation, and was a welcome stop after a few weeks on the road. I hope to be back at some point! Lovely!"
7.10.2014,5,we had a great stay and we stayed at the 'rose suite' room 242 and that was incredibly clever decorated ... much space..beautiful bathroom with bath and shower and a beautiful picture of a rose in the room.. no problems with noise from other rooms as you are here in a corner room and that is perfect..the sleep quality is on a very high level . Please look to my other reviews for the restaurants.. the swimming pool is also very beautiful and more than enough sun loungers..Here you should not fight for a deck chair..place enough.. the service in this hotel is more than ok and of a high standard. so don't hesitate and book. Last tip :book a room in the new part ..I prefer this part...
7.10.2014,5,"Wish I spent more time at this majestic hotel! 1 night stay at this property was flawless. The hotel has 2 buildings — historical and modern one, both facing the Adriatic Sea. Unfortunately there is no drive-in to the main façade entrance and you should drive back the building and enter the hotel from the back. As Wikipedia says the legendary hotel opened on 20 August 1910 at the time of Austro-Hungarian Empire to host rich and famous at Austrian Riviera. Indeed you feel like an Erzherzog on vacation as soon as you step into this palace hotel.Check-in was smooth and the reception girl escorted us to the room. Room at the modern spa building was spacious and luxury furnished. There was a big private balcony with sitting area. Hotel is large and has lots of facilities. First we tried lobby bar at the ground floor with outside seating. It serves the largest Aperol Spritz I have ever seen, 400 ml! Hotel has no beach, but there is a paid Medusa beach opposite the road. But do not waste your time (and money) at this beach — sea is not clean, lots of people, you pay for sun bed, you pay for a towel, every one is smoking and you have to breath this smoke. After the beach we went to the hotel’s spa, the pool and even Jacuzzi had seawater. Shame to me that I came to the beach instead of relaxing at hotel pool area free of charge!There are 2 restaurants at the hotel: contemporary and gourmet. We dined at contemporary one and it was fantastic. Great service, reasonable prices, great food with a clever presentation. I found one dish a bit overseasoned (grilled octopus) and I said that to waiter — don’t take me wrong, the dish was really good, but too much salt to my taste. When the bill arrived they didn’t charge overseasoned dish — it does credit to the hotel. The aftermeal drinks at Piano bar and the first floor were just perfect — the tastiest Belinni I have ever tried.Breakfast next morning was served at great ball room in the historical building with huge windows facing the park in front of the hotel. There were everything you may want for breakfast, difficult to list all the items. The hotel definitely worth every euro I sent there."
6.10.2014,5,"I’ve travelled to nearly 40 counties, and I can honestly say this is one of the most impressive hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The service is top notch from the moment you pull up to the entrance, and the entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in the modern part (there is also a traditional part) and our huge room had a comfortable bed, lots of storage space, a balcony and a large bathroom. It was also very quiet, which we appreciated. While the room itself was fantastic, the amenities are what you should really come for. There is a stunning outdoor pool as well as an indoor one and a hot tub, and THREE saunas that guests can use! We really enjoyed our time in the spa area, which was the perfect way to spend a rainy day. My husband also took advantage of the fantastic gym, which is something that is usually hard to find in Europe.Breakfast the next morning was also incredible, and the fast, free Wi-Fi was also great. Highly recommended!!!"
1.10.2014,5,"We traveled with 13 couples and stayed at the Kempiniski as we toured Slovenia and Croatia. Everything was excellent. The hotel had a classic feel while the room was new, clean and well appointed. Our corner room was quiet enough that you couldn't hear the church bells ringing but if needed, the porch allowed them to be heard. The breakfast was a great way to start the day with plenty of options and a stunning dining room and luxurious patio. Our experience at the spa was also excellent."
23.09.2014,5,"We stayed at the Kempinski Palace as part of a group tour of Slovenia. Our room was spacious, comfortable, and equipped with all the amenities you'd expect from a high-end hotel. We had a large balcony off of our room overlooking the water. The rooms were quiet and the service was excellent in all areas. The breakfast buffet was outstanding!"
23.09.2014,5,"Superb hotel and great location. Service was excellent. Views spectacular. A mix of modern and classic style its truly a lovely hotel. Staff were attentive and friendly. Breakfast was incredible lots of choice, you could graze all day. Would go back in a heartbeat. Thanks for sending on my left behind camera in such a fast manner, above and beyond."
23.09.2014,4,"We booked this place for a business trip for a few days for 200people.All of us were very delighted about the quality and look&feel of the hotel. Friendly staff and ok food.Nice about the place are the pools (in and outside) and it is located in front of the beach/sea, which allows for a swim in the sea, at a distance of 30sec by foot! Wonderful experience!"
19.09.2014,5,"We want to thank the Kempinski Palace for all the help and friendly smiles when we turned in our SIXT rental car. We were not staying there, but the staff was very helpful in showing us the best way to get to Piran and even calling our hotel to let them know we would be there at a certain time to check-in. Thank you to all that helped and if this is anyway how this hotel is run, it would be a great place to stay."
15.09.2014,5,"The Kempinski Palace is a perfect place to spend few days at this lovely city at Slovenian see. The high standard of Kempinski is guaranteed at this place. The building and rooms are wonderful and it feels modern and traditional at same time. We were at the modern part of the hotel (n237) but I am sure both parts are nice. The breakfast is just perfect - having a good meal outside, almost in the garden is phenomenal. The spa is also fine - we were not supported by the weather but - the sauna place is comfortable and near enough to be in private there and not disturbed by others. This is not the first time in Kempinski for us, but this was one of the best!The staff was great they always try to make your day. (last time Kateryna at reception was so helpful and kindness) Thank you all for your great work there and for the nice ""short"" holiday we had in Slovenia. Thanks."
14.09.2014,5,"Lovely, gorgeous stay.I was here for a wedding in July and stayed for 4 nights.Breakfast on the terrace is a throw back to scenes from the 1800s when lords and ladies dined in such manner. White linens, silver cutlery etc...Clean, modern, wonderful amenities.Classic Kempinski"
12.09.2014,5,"We had an overnight stop here. It was everything you expect - spacious, comfortable room with all amenities and sea view, good service, nice pool and gardens. Good wifi and computer with printer for guest use. It is across the road from the beach."
6.09.2014,5,"Kempinski Palace is by far the best hotel in the area. The Kempinski standards are met in every way. Staff is polite, welcoming and smiling at all times, the rooms are big and comfortable (ours was a superior sea view in the old building) and breakfast buffet was high quality with tons of fruits, meats, fish, cheeses, eggs (made on the spot), cereals, etc. and always fully stocked until 12pm! The saltwater swimming pool is half indoors and half outdoors and is a nice alternative on a hot sunny day since the area does not offer a variety of beautiful beaches. We have tried the Restaurant “Sophia” one night. The environment is elegant and the service impeccable. The wine list was a bit overpriced and the food itself was not to die for. Not value for money according to my opinion. Don’t miss the nearby village Piran. It is gorgeous!!"
1.09.2014,5,"A bunch of us (2 oldies and 5 from 19-25), 7 in all, have just spent 8 nights at this hotel. I'm afraid to say that the coffee at breakfast is not perhaps what it might be. The great news is that absolutely everything else was fabulous. The hotel feels like a palace and we were treated, if not quite like royalty, then something not too far removed. The rooms were extremely comfortable and the view from our room was easily one of the best I have ever had and we are reasonably seasoned travellers. I could go on, but it is the staff who make this a great experience. Faultless, committed and extremely hard working.We had originally planned to go to Trieste for a couple of days, but decided to extend our stay at The Kempinski, as long as we could. And we had been to Trieste before. All 7 of us had a ball.Portoroz itself is ok, but no more than that. However, Piran is easily walkable or runable along the coast path and there is plenty of public transport. Piran is a beautiful medieval town (part of Italy until 1954), that made its money off the back of selling salt to the Venetians. It is worth a number of visits. There are plenty of restaurants of all shapes and sizes around and in fact for those who moan about the cost of meals at the Kempinski, I would suggest you just get out of the hotel a bit. Slovenia may not yet be a culinary centre, but it is definitely on its way."
1.09.2014,4,"Overall very nice and pleasant 5* hotel. Checking experience disappointing-I asked receptionist what I can do in the town/hotel until my room will be ready and the answer was simply ""I don't know"". Next disappointing experience was queueing for 25min. to get fried egg for my breakfast (but it happened only during first day of stay = 26/08/14). Very limited choice during night from room-service restaurant (in most 5* hotels in London 90% of menu is available 24/7)."
30.08.2014,5,"This is a fantastic hotel, old school type, located on a lovely palace right across the Mediterranean sea.The indoor/outdoor swimming poll is very hard to resist, but the Mediterranean just across is also worth a dive.The rooms are specious and impeccably decorated."
30.08.2014,5,"Very pleasant, luxurious and calm hotel. Nice pool, sea very close but private beach for €20. Staff was friendly. Breakfast buffet as shoud be in 5?hotel. Espresso was pretty bad. Rusians everywhere. Restaurants in Portoroz are with same menu and the quality is very different. I do not recommend ""home wine"", the quality is usually quite low."
30.08.2014,4,"We did not stay at this hotel, we only went there in late morning for a cup of coffee. I must say that, although it was still breakfast time and there were hotel guests eating on the terrace, they served us just coffee with no problems. The service was a bit too anxious as three different waitresses came to our table to ask what we would like to have. Nevertheless, the presentation was really appealing, with cappucino served with lovely muffins on the side, and the apple juice we ordered was also very tasty. However, the cappucino foam was rather bland and not very consitent, really lacking in flavour, which was a bit disappointing. The external and interior decor of this establishment is simply stunning - very beautiful."
29.08.2014,5,"As a family of four we booked two rooms [via Inghams] with a preference that they be as close as possible but we were given one room in the old building a one room in the new building. They did however say one of us could move when a room nearer became available but in the event we both liked our different rooms and decided to stay put despite the distance between us [actually it wasn't difficult to move between rooms via the efficient lifts]. One room had a pleasant view of the hill at the rear of the hotel and a bath, the other had a side view and a walk-in shower instead of a bath, and arguably a better balcony but some noise from the road and a not so nice view. Both rooms had huge beds. Only a small bottle of water is provided on arrival and is not renewed. I thought the mini bar prices were steep but then it is a five star hotel. Breakfast is excellent and served on the terrace [though you can opt to eat inside]. The salt water pool was great and we never had a problem finding sun loungers. The hotel does not allow the reserving of loungers all day, towels are removed if the bed has been unattended for three hours. Personally, I thought that the hotel was the best thing about Portoroz but my wife would disagree on that! Certainly Portoroz is better for children than Piran and there is more space to chill out [soak up the sun]. Anyway, if you want a more interesting place, Piran is only 6 minutes away by frequent bus [fare 1Euro 50 cents] or about 15 minutes on the little land train for just a little more. The best place for either is outside the chemist, just to the left of the hotel [as you face it]. Or of course you can walk to Piran along the coast which is an easy 45 minutes stroll. And the hotel has free wifi too. It has a kids club but we never saw it operate. The evening turndown service makes you feel rather special too."
27.08.2014,5,"Definitely one of 5 best hotels I have ever visited. Starting with exterior, really big and dominant building in perfect condition, very nice and clean surroundings.Inside also many clever details like lifts in new building overlooking the spa etc...Spacious De Luxe room in new building with nice balcony overlooking the boulevard and sea. Sleeping quality also high. What I appreciated a lot, was food. No matter if breakfast or dinner, always amazing taste and quality. Of course staff was exceptional in every department, but after several Kempinski stays I finally realized that this is just their standard :)Beach Club Meduza (exclusive beach club for Kempinski guests) is not necessary due to big public beach just across the street, where you can rent umbrella and 2 beds for 17Euro per day. The beach high season occupation is max 50% so no crowd anywhere. If you stay with kids, they appreciate sandy beach and shallow water entrance here. Medusa has only grass and pier so no fun for kids.Another ""visit again Kempinski"" just have been found :)"
25.08.2014,4,"We have not stayed in Kempinski but had few lunches and dinners there. The food is always excellent, some combinations are rather unusual but all tasted nice. The staff was very attentive and their knowledge of wines was really second to none in Slovenia so far. it is not cheap but if you want to eat somewhere stylish and have really nice food, this is the place to go."
23.08.2014,5,"The hotel is fabulous, the best and most luxurious in Portoroz and Piran, Kempinski knows their thing. However, if you come during summer months, make sure to ask for a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the parking because the bars outside play very loud music until 1am which can be heard with the windows and blinds closed. The hotel has 2 sides: the oldest (but refurbished) side and the new one which has bigger rooms which are very cool and a tad kitsch. Very recommended!"
17.08.2014,5,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a week vacation at the Kempinski Portoroz. We give 5 stars plus! This is one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. The highlights for us: - The rooms are spacious, modern, and comfortable. The bathrooms are also a good size. The balcony is spacious. We stayed in the modern part. We loved the room. To add to that, the maid service was always excellent.- The hotel looks like a true palace. It is elegant and luxurious. It is a beautiful sight from outside and every detail is attended to inside.- The hotel concierge Kristijan and his team especially Micha and Peter are professional, caring, and go above and beyond. They took care of us from start to finish so a special thanks! In fact, all the staff were excellent.- Breakfast! The included hotel breakfast from 7-12 has an incredible offering EVEN champagne. Was worth it every morning. If you get Room service, try the Palace Club Sandwich.- Spa: we had a great couple's massage. Was worth every Euro.- Pool: this is one of the best hotel pools we have experienced. Not too crowded, adequate but not overbearing service, comfortable temperature in the salt water pool, jacuzzi, etc. Great to lay out in the sun and relax all day.- the town of Portoroz and surrounding area. Piran is a romantic, beautiful town just 5 minutes away. We also found the drive down the Croatian coast worth the trip.The only points of feedback we have:- the restaurant Sophia left a little to be desired. We enjoyed a romantic dinner in a lovely setting but the guest chef's tasting menu was not up to what we were expecting. We suggest RiziBizi, half way between the hotel and Piran instead.- We were overcharged for parking - but when we asked it was quickly corrected.- the beach in Portoroz is really nothing special. For tourists used to a nice beach, this is NOT it. But we found that the hotel pool as well as beaches in Croatia made up for this. This is obviously not the hotel's fault.Thanks again to the entire staff. This hotel is worth it and we would stay again!"
14.08.2014,5,Didn't stay at the hotel but went for a drink on the terrace which was exceptional. My mom said the martini was the best she has ever had and she has been to a lot of places. I just thought it had merit for a review. Thanx
14.08.2014,5,"Could not fault this hotel in any way, everything is done with great attention to detail and to very high standards. Staff are fantastic, charming and welcoming. We'd single out Carmen on reception and Allen who served drinks pool side, who were particularly friendly and helpful. We went for a three night break and had two rooms in the old part of the building with a park view, which was all very pleasant. We enjoyed night caps in the bar on the terrace and would recommend their house cocktail a Kempinski no.1. Pool and spa suite were great but one of the highlights was the amazing breakfast on the terrace."
10.08.2014,4,"The Kempinski is a beautifully restored historical hotel linked to a modern annex. Rooms in the annex (where I stayed) are spacious, comfortable and well appointed. They have a large balcony facing the ocean and the pool. As another reviewer said, staff were very professional and not pompous. Breakfast buffet offered a variety of cold and hot dishes. Internet connection worked perfectly. It is very well located and there is a bus stop to Piran right in front of the hotel. On the negative side, I would alert guests that the saltwater swimming pool is a bit small for the number of guests and may be hard to find a place in the sun. Parking is not free either. And, although it is a beach resort, there is no beach service in the hotel. So if you really want to go to the beach you must use the beach club opposite (which you also have to pay for)."
9.08.2014,5,"What a pleasant surprise to be upgraded from a Deluxe Sea View to an absolutely amazing Suite in the new section of the hotel! The staff were very professional yet friendly (not pompous - thank you!), the suite and terrace was breathtaking, location excellent, has secure parking (understatement!), and the list goes on....This was my first visit and I'd love to return in the future. Keep up the good work!"
2.08.2014,5,"Overall this is a good choice if you want to feel pampered on holiday! We had a room facing the park on the fourth floor and were quite happy with this choice. We did find it strange though that all the balconies only had one chair on them. The other minus points are lack of daily complimentary bottle of water, no tea/coffee-making facilities, and the chage for parking. The pool is really good - you can actually swim in it. The breakfast is by far the best we've ever had. I doubt if we'd return because Portoroz itself is not the ideal holiday venue for us and I'm not 100% convinced that the price the hotel charges is totally warranted. During our midweek stay at the end of July there was no entertainment - everything seemed to be organised for weekends or August."
1.08.2014,5,"Great staff, nice rooms and suites. As GHA members, we got upgrade from room to suit and were very happy with big terrace and two separate rooms. There is big indoor and outdoor pool with sea water, and it is really super, because there is no good beach in Portoroz (my opinion). The only one minus - the bars and restaurants outside of hotel are very noisy.Inside the hotel is very quiet.We are coming to this hotel very often and can recommend it to everyone."
30.07.2014,5,"For a luxury traveler ""best hotel and best value"" often don't go hand in hand but I am happy to say that this is the case at the Kempinski Palace Portoroz. Great location, lovely gardens, nice selection of restaurants (all with good food) and BEAUTIFULLY renovated rooms. Everything is so luxurious- the gorgeous marble bathrooms, the sumptuous fabrics, the deep and cozy beds... I could go on but you get the picture and no detail has been missed. I kept looking around wondering how they could make money with such a wonderful property charging so little. In most world beach resorts you'd pay much more for much less. I can hardly wait to go back and highly recommend the property. Pay extra for a room with a view of the water- so worth it."
21.07.2014,5,"the quality, service and accommodation live up to the 5* standards, perfectly located in the centre of Portorozthe breakfast choice is amazing as well as the hotel pool and its facilitiesthe only things I'd complaint about is the wallet parking which i do not personally like cause I feel much comfortable parking my car on my own and the beach service in nearby meduza clubit's little ridiculous that it's not included in room rate but you have to pay extra 20 euros per day per person also the service at the reception was little slow considering we arrived in June (during peak season)otherwise I'd definitely recommend the hotel"
19.07.2014,3,"We booked a suite at the last minute for a couple of days in high season at a pretty high price tag. We had been used to very good Kempinski service in Munich and other locations during an extended European driving vacation so we had anticipated a similar experience in Portoroz.Our ""Rose Suite"" overlooking the pool was smallish but Ok for the price and season.At check-in we found the suite to be plagued with a heavy musty/spicy odour so we asked for a replacement room. No alternate rooms were available so after a few hours we were satisfied that housekeeping was able to remedy the smell.After returning to our room while waiting for it to be freshened up and wanting a fresh shower we were surprised to discover no soap in the suite and a towel shortage. Later, in the midst or an international call and needing to jot down some notes, I find no paper or pen in the desk.Calls to the front desk resolved each of these issues in very short order but still a disappointment at this price point.Also, no waters were provided at bed turn-down which is very, very disappointing in a hotel suite of this calibre and price. Otherwise we found the property very much to our liking.Note that the sea view rooms at the front of the hotel may be exposed to some late night party noise from the beach bars across the street."
18.07.2014,5,"In het Nederlands gezegd: ik was echt wel fantastisch blij met de service. I was delighted. People worked in the hotel as if it wat their own. People were disciplined, OK, but they kept their own style. Staff was devoted to Kempinsky while staying who they are and serving us as a client in the best possible way. Especially Simona from the massage and Theresa from the Stradivaria rock concept struck us. But above all, Bori, from Hungaria, the most exciting waitress we ever met as a family, wat a real experience. How she managed to serve the intrest of the hotel, combine that with a personal touch towards the client (us) and stay authentic in the woman she is, enthousiastic about what she does and in te mean time customizing the service to the client: waw. She is representative to the feeling we (myself, my wife and my three children (22 , 19 and 16 years old) have of Kempinsky and the Slovenian way of treating customers: great. Thank you all."
14.07.2014,5,"the hotel is positioned by the beach > We were in the modern art and had a very sumptious ""garden view"" as there were no sea view rooms available at the time. The room and the public areas are excellent. tso problems: the promised WI FI in the room did not work and on a busy day our room was not made by 2 pm. They made it when we left for dinner. Breakfast was very generous and pleasant to eat out on the terrace. The staff are friendly and very helpful. We stayed there for 5 nights and enjoyed our syay immensely"
10.07.2014,5,"We had a fabulous week at the Palace hotel. We were in the new section ,on the second floor with a large ,well equipped room facing the sea and overlooking the pool area and the Fleur de Sel restaurant. We ate in that restaurant twice and whilst they were the most expensive meals of our holiday,the food and service were faultless. We always took breakfast in the Chandelier room which is magnificent - lovely high ceilings ,stuccoed walls . You could imagine royal balls taking place there in the past ! Most people took breakfast on the Terrace, which ,whilst lovely, meant a long trek to the buffet. Having said that the breakfast selection was massive and of very high quality.We did feel that a lot of space is underused -especially the Chandelier room. It should be the premier room of the hotel,not for a few people at breakfast. Reception staff were very helpful. We particularly enjoyed taking pre dinner drinks n one of the balconies off the piano room on the mezzanine floor(facing the sea. )I'm glad we chose this hotel which ticked all the right boxes"
8.07.2014,5,The property and staff were amazing. The breakfasts were delicious. The views from our room great. The rooms were well spacious and well appointed. The bed linens were mediocre. Would definitely go back again.
8.07.2014,4,For birthday present i got to spend a weekend in Kempinski. We had a lovely room in the new side of the hotel. The rooms are very spacius and lovely decorated with an view to the Slovenian see. The weather was realy nice so we enjoyed every single minute in Portoroz. The breakfast choice was very big and the dining area is beautiful. Staff is nice and very helpful. For sure one of the best hotel in Portoroz.
25.06.2014,5,"We had a week in the Kempinski and loved it! Now back to work, back home walking the dog in the rain, cooking my own food and making my own bed, I appreciate the luxury we enjoyed all the more.The hotel consists of the original. sumptuously fitted out building with a new extension attached which contains the spa and pool as well as some upgraded rooms with large balconies and a restaurant with outdoor balcony.We had a deluxe park view room, in the new part, which was huge with a wrap around balcony containing pots of scented jasmin. The bathroom was pretty spacious and the service was indeed impeccable with rooms serviced twice a day. Breakfast was typical of what I've seen in 5 stars with the addition of Slovenian bubbly available with fresh strawberries which is a great way to start the day! The crystal room is beautiful. There was a private function when we were there and when we passed the chandeliers glittered and the glasswork shone like something you see in a movie.We ate in the Sophia restaurant (twice) and we had a table set up on the lawn after a glass of champage in Bubbles. The whole experience was so special thanks to the excellent staff. The food in the hotel was easily the best we had over the week.How can I last until my next visit?!!!!"
25.06.2014,5,"Stayed there for 3 nights past week.Hotel is managed excellent.It is truely the best Slovenian hotel, but there are still things to be corrected:-at breakfast we got dry croissants,-there were tree leafs in the pool at same place for all 3 days- also some dirt around the pool-waitors at pool were slow as snails-ordered freshly squeezed orange juice at poll and got some mixture little fresh and artificial one-still missing hotel sea beach--last day some problems with bad room cleaningOtherwise everthing else is perfect....All in all still 9 out of 10...Please do smth. on things mentioned, I am coming back this year."
24.06.2014,5,"well, that is the Hotel. and that is what a 5-stars hotel should be. good location, though across the street from the sea. impeccable service, brilliant interiors. we had a huge suit with an even more spacious terrace with a jacuzzi right on the terrace. the pool area is also very nice. the gym is tiny, surprisingly tiny for such a large building, but the rest was so marvelous, that this small gym wasn't a big deal"
24.06.2014,3,"We have stayed 3 nights in this Kempinski Hotel. The price of the hotel would be okay, if you would get, what you have payed for.While checking in, we have experienced many problems, which are shocking for this kind of property. We have explicitely booked room with balcony and sea view. We have been told upon arrival, that there are no rooms with balcony available. How can this happen, if you book and pay your room in advance?! How can Kempinski sell the rooms, if they don't have them? After almost 1 hour of trying to find sollution, we have been given a room on 1st flor with ""trees view"" and something they call ""french balcony"" about 50cm wide. No chairs, no table. So you cannot enjoy the view. But who cares, on 1st floor there's no view at all anyways. This was a huge disapointment, as I know, they had more rooms available, as our friends arrived later, and have been given an upgrade to suites with 2 balconies on 3rd floor! I felt really cheated. Other weird thing - we have asked to provide an iron, to iron some shirts we needen, they told us, its not possible and we were forced to give them to house keeping and payed about 40 Euro for few shirts and pair of jeans to get pressed. I kind of hoped, they will not charge us for this after messing up our reservation and giving us crap rooms, but I was mistaken.Other room facilities are okay, rooms are properly cleaned. Pool and wellness area very small! Breakfast was okay, but if you are eating on the terrace, and leave your table for a minute or two to get some more stuff, the birds will make a mess on your table immediately.I wouldn't stay here again, Not only the hotel cheated us, but did not offer any compensation at all. I am very disapointed by Kempinski Palace in Portoroz, as they do not live up their standards they are famous for."
20.06.2014,5,I spent 4 days in thih Hotel. The rooms are great. They are paying attention to a small details. Every few hours somebody is coming to clean a room. The position off the hotel is great because is situated in the old part of the town. The employers should smile more and talk more languages but they were ok.The spa is small but cute.The food is great. 
9.06.2014,5,"We've spend 4 days in Kempinski Palace Portoroz 3 weeks ago. Everything was amazing, from the start, when we've entered the hotel, procedure for registration was very short, girl on the reception desk very kind and we were upgraded to the lagoon apartment on the top floor, with stunning view over the sea. Apartment has 2 rooms, one big toilet, small wc, very spacious antre and the best part...approximately 80m2 terrace with jacuzzi. Service in the hotel is absolutely amazing, breakfast excellent, atmosphere in the hotel very nice and calm...really great experience, we are coming again for sure..."
6.06.2014,4,"Six years ago when this beautiful jewel in the crown of Slovenian hotels was finally completely refurbished and upgraded, its atmosphere was somewhat too presumptuous and dignified. However, it was a truly remarkable hotel with perfect service and imperial splendor. The only bothering issue at the time was a ridiculuous drinks markup.Now something has changed during the last two years, the reason for my review update. It is well known that the local owners, facing bankruptcy, are trying desperately to sell at EUR 40 million, having invested well above a hundred. No money, no funny. The clientelle is different at the first glance, thanks to truly formidable discounts via some booking systems. Fittingly, the rose garden is partly unprunned, there is no water in a lovely system of connected miniature ponds, personnel in the pool area is hard to find and not overly attentive. Water in the pool is kept at regrettable 24 degrees, same as the air around the interior part of the pool. Cold. The hotel, even though quite full, gave the impression of a ghost hotel with shops deserted, and some of the all too numerous bars closed.Our check-in was friendly and quick, but with flaws for the first time. Room was fine, though far less spacious than one might be led to believe considering the 5-star DeLuxe level. Sizeable bathroom. The mattress showed its age through a visible depression left by too many bodies, and was consequently far from what we were used to previously. A small spider's web above the TV was an interesting fringe benefit.Obviously the cost containment measures went all too far also regarding service. As I am slightly familar with the Kempinski protocols, I was appalled. Nobody to sit you for breakfast (the host's desk is very obviously there, but nobody around, so people waited in vain before taking the initiative in their own hands), tables were set in the very simplest possible way, no smile on personnel's faces, a young lady with an extremely annoyed face who brought us cappuccinos simply put them down between us (!) with a bang... How completely different from the previous time two years ago, when everything was smooth and perfect, if not warm and friendly.Current hotel cuisine keeps tradition of the German style fine cooking and is surely one of the best three in Portorož. Fine, but not a major achievement. Unheated plates for a warm course during a serious dinner are not something I would ever expect and understand. Furthermore, markups for beverages remain a disgrace to the management and a turn-off for the guest. The excellent French patisseur and the previous German chefs have all left together with the management's ambition to create a truly remarkable hotel for the most distinguishing guest.It surely still is one of the Slovenia top hotels, No 1 or 2, but this says more about the level of the rest of the pack. Thereagain, the previouos very high level has gone down in each and every respect. I regret that. Even though I am sure that the hotel will feel very different during the traditional BMW days, it is none of my concern. I hope a new ownership will restore the splendor."
2.06.2014,4,"The hotel is without a doubt a very good one. However, under the name Kempinski I expected perfection, and this was not always achieved. The rooms are big enough, big bathroom and lovely balcony (we stayed in a modern part of the hotel), however the air-con did not work properly. After first hot night of bad sleep I complained about the temperature and the thermostat to one of the staff who came to the room, but he said those were the fixed settings of the hotel. Only at the checkout the reception mentioned that they could have done something about it, if they had known the problem. Three nights of not really good sleep. One night we tried with the balcony door open, but that night the drunken youth were shouting and singing somewhere not so far from the hotel so this option was also off. The bed pillows were also not worthy the 5star hotel. Breakfast was not very well organised. At the entrance there is a sign for you to register and wait to be seated. This was actually done the first day, the other days no one was there (once we naively waited there for some minutes before we figured out that nobody cares). I had to constantly ask for bread baskets (available first day only), one day we had to wait quite long for them to bring tea jars and teacups to make a tea... Which was pity because the serving staff that waited the tables outside on the terrace were absolutely wonderful, kind and attentive, as were a lot of other hotel personnel. The spa and pool area is great and the beach is just across the street - excellent location. All in all, if they can really solve the air conditioning problem in each room, we will probably come back."
27.05.2014,5,"Great hotel in fantastic location in a little-known area of Europe. Just a 30-minute drive from Trieste, a beautiful italian city and also very close from Croatia.The hotel itself is very comfortable, with a beautiful ballroom and two very good restaurants. The spa is awesome. The pool, half indoors, half outdoors is great for anyone who likes to swim laps. The staff is friendly and multi-lingual.On the improvable side: no coffee-tea making facilities in the rooms, random opening hours in the shopping gallery. Overall, a highly commendable hotel."
14.05.2014,4,"I spent there 2 nights right after Easter in this really great hotel in Portoroz. They offer excellent services and a top breakfast, which offers a very wide selection of everything, making the start into the day very promising. We had one of the luxury rooms in the older part of this Grand Hotel, offering a perfect overview over the beach.The SPA area is nearly perfect, only we missed a separate area on the beach (or we just heve not found it, anyway the weather was not so perfect as the hotel was . . .)"
13.05.2014,4,"I spent 3 nights in this place in May 14, in a standard room in the new building, facing the old one. Room is nice, bed is large and comfortable. Bathroom is nice, with shower and bathtub. Cleanliness was perfect.Breakfast is very good and there is lots of choices to make you happy. Unfortunately, no fresh juice is offered, you have to do it yourself. Croissants were not very good and didn't sound from the morning. The hotel has two sea water pool, an outdoor one and an indoor one. Service was very pool at the pool area: no one to welcome you, give you towels and prepare your chair. It was disturbing, as if nobody cares! Chairs are not numerous, so if the hotel is a bit crowded, I guess the pool area will turn into a battlefield.Fitness room is very small but is enough to make some exercise. Space is limited so be careful if the hotel is crowded.To sum up, comfortable place and quiet but be careful if the hotel is crowded, amenities are not made to satisfy every guest. Note the Portoroz is not a very interesting place : beach is poor, the only interesting thing to see is Piran, very close to Portoroz. "
27.04.2014,5,"The rooms are lovely, the pool is wonderful and the breakfast that goes til noon is decadent. The service is very thoughtful and attentive . We loved our stay and hope to get an opportunity to come back!"
20.04.2014,5,"Great staff, clean room, great breakfast!!! Our room was a rose suite, with sea view and great balcony. We stayed in modern part of hotel, there is bigger rooms. Wonderfull place. Hotel is located in the centre of Portoroz."
15.04.2014,3,"The staff is kind and well trained so far. The place itself is one of the prettiest in the whole area for sure.Therefore it is really disappointing after having booked my room for 7 nights (deluxe) and for my daughter with her boyfriend for 5 nights (superior) that my daughter was given a small room in the ""historical"" part which was a bit run down. After she disagreed with this room she was said the hotel is fully booked. At this time I was out, so I complained by phone and after 20 minutes she was able to change room to the modern part close to my room. What she was not informed about was that the room was a smoker room, what is disgusting for no smokers. So I had to intervene a second time the following day and a correct room according to our booking was provided.May be because of the age of 24 years the. receptionist is advised to fill the less nice rooms to such young guests. As we arrived with two cars we liked to go out in one car one evening therefore I left my car after loading my bicycles in front of the entrance after having been advised by the door boy to park it that way and went up to my room after no carboy was available to park the car in the garage. I called down to ask to bring the other car to use for the evening.I received a call from the manager personally commanding me arrogantly to come down to remove my car immediately. Paying 40 bucks for two cars and being corrected that way made me feel not like guest but like an employee. I assume it is not my job to look for the carboy. The staff is really kind but the manager could learn from his staff a lot.Michael Guth Munich"
8.04.2014,5,"As exceptionally fortunate and frequent travellers to Europe, we have a number of very favourite hotels in Europe including Hotel Alfonso VII in Seville, the Bretagne in Athens, Prince De Galle in Paris and San Domenico Palace in Taomina however we have now a new favourite.From arrival with immediate assistance with luggage and valet parking to a seamless fast check in, we felt immediately welcomed and valued as guests of the Kempinski Palace.Our room was a deluxe room in the new wing with a sea view and balcony. It was large, well appointed, cleverly designed ( a frequent whinge of mine is suitcase storage- well catered here) and oozed luxury. Don't skimp and miss the sea view with a view also over the pool area and sunsets.Breakfast was another hedonistic delight on a sun soaked terrace in front of the majestic old wing - great selections including perfectly fresh produce presented by wonderful staff. Added bonuses were a late noon finish to breakfast allowing plenty of time and lessening the guilt of that glass or two of prosecco!Pre dinner drinks in the main bar ( across the 'air bridge' connecting the 2 wings) was another event we embraced with gusto - whether taken in the elegant and refined in the main area or on the terraces, service was sophisticated and bespoke and pricing more than fair.Regrettable we did not have an opportunity to enjoy the other and numerous eating and drinking options such as the 'bubbles' room or Sophia's.The staff were simply exemplary at every interaction and reflect extremely well on managementEverything about our stay was almost perfect - in fact if searching for any negatives , and the first will sound petty, my only gripes were the course recycled toilet tissue and the second being the day pool man whose job description is apparently limited to 'watching' only guests shuffle pool lounges and grapple with umbrellas.We will be back and next time for a much longer stay!"
15.03.2014,5,"Nice pool with sea water, so no need to go to the beach, which is not clean. Great staff, very polite and always friendly. Breakfast is very good,rooms are big enough to keep baby cot or extra bed. Definitely will go back, as we do every summer."
28.02.2014,5,"This Hotel cannot get much better with gorgeous rooms and grounds. The breakfast outside on the veranda is amazing - everything you can possibly imagine with impeccable service. The location is perfect - directly across the street from the ocean, with many small shops and restaurants nearby. Of course it is expensive, but it is highly recommended."
9.02.2014,5,"I booked this hotel becouse of I know the company Kempinski. I stayed in Bratislava and in Budapest before. Wonderful very ancient building seaward with lot of facilities.Comfortable room, spacious bathroom, nice view. Room service excellent especially in the afternoon.Parking space in the garage at € 18,00 a day. Flawless service also for the recepetion and concierge. I did not try the restaurant as It was two expensive in my opinion. I had a drink in the the bar but the price was so high .. Breakfast was magnificent It was served from 8,00 to 12,00.You could have everything you liked even champagne and strawberrys. This hotel is highly recommended, .Nice SPA I delighted the pool and sauna .I was satisfied about the price I paid at the check out . Good price for a good service and a pleasant stay."
8.02.2014,5,"If you are looking for style and luxury at the Slovenian coast, this is probably the place to be. Very tastefull interior. The breakfast is enormous in variety and you either sit on the gigantic terras overlooking the Adrian see, or in the balroom. The bar is excuisite, but expensive, very good wine though. Dinner is good in quality but pricy and not too many clients for such a big venue."
21.01.2014,5,"We were there for the wine festival and it was a special offer. We were not satissfed with the festival, but everything else was superb. Very good value for the money.As allready mentioned in reviews before staff is very professional, hotel is design very modern with some touch of the history. Rooms modern and clean and sleep quality is the best i have ever had. If you are not happy with the breakfast here there is no help with you anymore:)Would recommended this hotel for sure!"
16.01.2014,5,"Beautiful grand hotel with an amazing atmosphere and a great location in the charming city of Portoroz. Very good service, nice staff, huge breakfast buffet in the most impressive breakfastroom i have visited. Luxurious rooms and an overall very good experience."
12.01.2014,5,"Ok , 9 out of 10.Certainly, there were some little thinghs that should not have happened, like cleaning lady forgot to change towels in our room in the evening, variety of breakfast food is bigger, when there is main season.In wellness there was no tea...Other wise, the staff is super professional.It can be seen, that they are lead by Kempinski.Very different to other Slovenian hotels, which are lead by locals!We have become a member of GHA and we got a room upgrade.In that perspective we made 2 more reservations for this year.I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE MANAGER:We had usually spent some summer vacation in other Portorož hotels, cause there is no sea beach that belongs to hotel.Medusa Exclusive-beach, is an extra sucharge to room.I would expect it to be included in the room price....IS THIS YEAR GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT?"
4.12.2013,4,"It was a business trip, so I wouldn't know about the value for money bit; but it offered all the comfort and luxury you would expect from a Kempinski. Rooms are superb, food delicious (not much variety, but I think that's even a plus because it reduces waste), the location very central (very close to supermarket, restaurants, casinos, post office - right by the sea side), the staff very well trained..."
3.12.2013,4,I stayed at the hotel during my business visit to koper. The staff is very friendly and kind unlike what I was told about Slovenia and they were particularly nice in the bar below the reception area.Comfortable rooms and good over all ambience in the hotel. Felt like the many kempinski's I have stayed at earlier.Would surely recommend
1.12.2013,4,"The location and building are superb. A place you simple like to stay with on top of that the warm welcome and perfect reception with full attention to detail. Rooms and facilities are according the standards and value for money. To go short.. perfect for a stay.The dining was a disaster; an old fashioned business model based on formalities, long waiting, small portions and high pricing in a rich atmosphere. Lack of a good feeling among the staff and clearly trained in servicing people according a fixed template. Also the quality of the food is poor.Bottom line;; stay there but go a few steps outhouse for dining"
12.11.2013,5,"Stayed here for 3 days with my wife, and after reading all the comments we had high expectations about the hotel, and it didnt disapoint! Rooms are spacious, everything was quality made in the whole hotel, breakfast was included and it was fabulouse, with all kind of food to choese from. Went to lunch in a hotel's restaurant, and had one of the best stakes i have had in a while. Only problem to me was cold water in swimming pool, and very expencive mini bar. Everything else was better than expected. Will definitly plan to come back again!"
10.11.2013,5,"And stay in this hotel, it is worth your while. On arrival we asked if we could have another room with more light, which was possible, not one was shown to us, but several. Overall, nice decor, centrally located, friendly staff, spa facilities were good and modern, great outdoor swimming pool, room colourful and tastefully designed, spacious bathroom (room 437), breakfast was certainly one of the best we have ever experienced, very nice breakfast hall (during the weekend it can get crowded), and because breakfast was served till noon, you could have a quiet moment at the terrace in front of the hotel, reading your paper and 'recovering' from great breakfast choices. We stayed here in October, Portoroz is very quiet then, when we went out at night to have dinner in a restaurant (or in Piran), we were often the only ones there. Mostly elderly crowd (Eastern Europe, Germans, Austrians) during that time of year, autumn. Car park at the hotel takes 18 euros a day, in front of the hotel 12. Kempinski, great brand! Nice experience for a relaxing week."
2.11.2013,5,We stay here 1st time in april during E holiday for 3 days and it was for us amazing. Our next visit was in Sept. For 3 day and again no problem. Realy best hotel in town. Good spacious rooms with wifi and sea wiew breakfast from 7 till 12 with plenty of choice. Fast service.On evening we try spa an was nice place for relax. This is best place where to go for a short 3 days relax with wife in Portoroz.Recomended. We was in old part of hotel and it was nice room with history inside. If we will visit Portoroz we will go again to this hotel.
26.10.2013,5,"Travelling with three friends.The hotel was easy to find and had valet parking. Reception was a bit 'modern' for my taste: two low desks where you are invited to sit while being checked in. I can imagine it being a bit of a nightmare to check in or out if a coach party arrives just before you. From arriving at the hotel the staff were very friendly and very professional: a credit to the Kempinski name. My room was in the new wing of the hotel and I believe that these are the best rooms. I asked (and was given) a park-view room as these are the quietest in the hotel. A friend and a sea-view room and noted that he could hear the music from the bars very clearly (he solved that problem by staying in the bars until they shut!).The bar in the hotel is very good and up to the usual Kempi standards. Their breakfast though demands a special mention. Breakfast is served until 12:00. This is very civilised indeed and the rest of the Kempinski chain should follow suit! The quality of the breakfast was also excellent with a very wide selection of cold meats, fresh fruit, pastries, breads, cereals and the usual hot items with omelettes, poached eggs, eggs benedict all being available from the chef. The gym was small and the cardio equipment was good quality. For weights they had a very limited selection of machines and a reasonably selection on free weights. There is also a good swimming pool (and an outside pool)Considering the price, I found this to be a faultless hotel and would happily stay there again and recommend it to my friends."
8.10.2013,4,"I ve been there to attend a meeting, the hotel is excellent and the service was very friendly. There still are things you don t expect in a five stars hotel, insect nets (outside the hotel near the glass wall), small rooms and slippery bath tub. I asked twice to get my shirts pressed. Also for people going there please beware of the revolving door as you might get your head hit if you get into it from the right angle."
5.10.2013,1,"We booked a suite and arrived in anticipation as this was our first experience with a Kempinski Hotel, we normally stay at Aman Resorts or St. Regis properties and are very frequent travellers. There was supposed to be a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine on arrival it was not there after asking for it on three occasions it finally arrived.The suite??? was small and the bathroom cramped so if two people were in the bathroom at one time you were bumping into each other all the time. The shower was something that I would relate to a Accor Formula One not a supposedly five star property. During the night the room was hot and stuffy with the air-conditioning not working, I contacted the Duty Manager and he was all apologies and said he would get us a larger suite and have the air-conditioning looked at, nothing came of this and I again had to make contact. This time I was told that all other suites had been booked out, mind you I had made this reservation three weeks prior. I was told the air-conditioning had been adjusted, however this was not the case and we had to open all the doors leading outside to cool the room down, this however gave us more grief with the traffic noise from the road. Sorry but if this is a typical Kempinski property, then it will be our last. For the persons expecting a suite to the standards they usually expect you will not find it here. Not a cheap room by any standard being charged 338 Eu. per night, sorry not for us."
30.09.2013,4,"We had a large seaview room in the original section of the hotel. The original architecture failed to capitalize on the views, and our room had two small double doors to a narrow Juliette balcony. Colleagues in the new section had a balcony to step out on but slightly smaller room. Comfortable bed, good mini bar, excellent buffet breakfast, and a superb pool complex with a well equipped small gym above. Staff were solemnly efficient. We were staying at the end of the season so the whole resort was quiet. Conference facilities and catering were very adequate for our meetings. I'd return for a short stay in luxury."
25.09.2013,4,"The Kempinski Portorož is where the quality is. The superb location: the promenade, local cousine restos, bars and shops are just at front of the hotel. We enjoyed the pool and spa area. The breakfast is abundant and healthy. My negative experience refers to the hotels's night turn down service (which is a kind of lightweight) and ignorant reception staff (they sent me to the business center which is inoperative)"
25.09.2013,5,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel. Absolutely stunning. The service is great, the food is great, the rooms are spacious. I stayed in the modern part of the hotel. The hotel is also equipped with many amenities particular suitable to the business traveller such as gym, spa, fully loaded mini bar, etc."
16.09.2013,5,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel. I slept on the 2nd floor in a double room in the old wing of the hotel. The quality of sleep is guaranteed. The mattress is awesome-wide, cushions are soft - or hard - you find both. The bathroom was very spacious. If I really need to find something, then the divisor glass of the shower could be a little bit longer to cover the rest of the bathroom from the water, but this is really not THAT disturbing (maybe if you use the bathroom in two in the same moment, you MIGHT get wet if one takes the shower and the other one is sitting on the loo, so you see..I had to make up a situation).Breakfast is just brilliant. They have such a good assortment of cereals, fruit. Warm or cold breakfast...Here also just one thing: when the balcony is full of guests, it might take a while to get a coffee - this is one thing, you can't prepare on your own, but you have to order it from the staff. It might be a good idea to have one person always there, who takes the orders.Friends, who tried the spa were delighted.I absolutely would come back anytime and suggest you to choose this place, if you are around."
16.09.2013,4,"Perfect hotel - everything new, clean, very friendful staff (night boy even opened all hotel shops to find a swimming suit!). Pool was perfect - with salt water. The only drawback - the beach, which is not the hotel property, - small and a bit dirty. But if you relax only at the pool, than that's the best choise!"
14.09.2013,5,"Stayed 6 nights in deluxe rooms at the front of the hotel with sea facing balconies (rooms 306 & 310). The hotel is majestic and almost flawless with great facilities, and cleanliness and service throughout is first class. We enjoyed the sumptuous breakfasts which are served in an opulent crystal ball room, or on the outside veranda. The swimming pool and jacuzzi areas are spacious and immaculately maintained. Portoroz itself is a reasonable location, with good coastal walking and a selection of restaurants/bars/shops, but we spent the evenings in neighbouring Piran, which is a small, but beautiful and impressive medieval town set on a peninsula, and a real jewel on the Adriatic coast. We had great fish meals at Pri Mari and Pavel which we highly recommend. We walked in a few times along the pretty coastal path, and other times we took the reliable local bus which leaves from outside the Kempinski every 15 minutes, and costs about €1 each way.The only downside we experienced was two consecutive disturbed nights on the Friday and Saturday due to extremely loud music at the front of the hotel which continued until around 2am each night (on one occasion from a bar opposite the hotel, and on the other occasion from a function at the hotel, almost directly under our room). Those wanting a guaranteed peaceful life might be advised to choose a park view room, away from the hotel's function room. Despite this blip, the overall experience was highly enjoyable and we strongly recommend the hotel."
13.09.2013,4,I spend six days in Kempinski Palace and really loved the hotel. The rooms were clean and service was excellent. However the restaurant choices of the hotel are not that fantastic. I found both restaurants to have few choices. Would have enjoyed it hundred percent if the hotel could have had a buffet choice for lunch as well.
3.09.2013,5,"All I can say is, beautiful hotel. I loved everything about this hotel. Our room was clean, service was excellent, as well as breakfast. We have booked with Kempinski again, this time in Croatia. Would recommend this hotel to everyone."
2.09.2013,5,"My friend and I went for a coffee and later on we took some long drinks. Bar above pool has a nice view, and we had excellent brainstorm on our new novel. We spent there some hours, and it was a pitty we had to leave as that particular table was reserved for a dinner. Service is good, drinks too."
30.08.2013,5,"I have seen the complains in some of the previous reviews about the long waiting times and the hotel is being overcrowded. At the end of august I experienced none of these. We always had a table to eat at, and a poolside sunbed to lying on.The hotel is fantastic, nearly perfect on a measure where perfection exists only in theory. And believe me it is not easy to impress me. I could try to describe with a dozen words how helpful and friendly the staff was but again perfect is the most suitable word. They easily and instantly solved every problem/request we had... if we had.We got our room in the modern part. It was spacious even with an extra bed for our little son. The furniture is well-designed and luxurious... we had a nice balcony as well. We loved the bathroom especially when we had to gone there during the first overnight and realized that the marble floor is heated to be nice and warm for your barefoot. Wow! They check and clean the room multiply times a day so it was absolutely spotless.The wellness unit of the hotel is very nice. I have spent an hour or more there every single day. The pools are filled with sea water (salty). The hotel has no direct beach connection you need to cross a road and the promenade to reach the sea. We haven't tried the dedicated Kempinski beach (extra 20EUR per person per day) because there were lots of free spots on the public beaches. It you need the sunbed and the sunshade on the beach you can still rent it everywhere for 5-10EURs.It is not easy to find any shortcoming in this hotel. If I try hard I can enumerate only two:- while I got my breakfast the tables should have been cleaned by my used plates more frequently- the extra bed is very confortable but it was a little bit creaky"
30.08.2013,5,"It was the first time to be at Kempinski Portoroz hotel, when we arrived we had a warm welcome by receptionist.The service is excellent, the superior room (we stayed at 401 - park side) is spacious and comfortable and well decorated. The bad is very comfortable (not too soft and not too hard). The bathroom is really magnificant. The pool is small, but anyway it's nice and u can find a good space to lay down. The breakfast - u have a lot of choice of warm and cold food. The crystall hall is really nice, but it's more nice to seat outside on the terras."
28.08.2013,5,"We have been there many times and it still is perfect. The service is good, rooms are clean and nice. The spa area is beautiful and relaxing. Pool is a bit small, but it´s OK. Tip: don´t have dinner at the hotel, there is a perfect restaurant just the opposite of the hotel, you don´t see it at first, but you can see it from the beach. It was called Porto del mar Portorož (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Porto-del-mar-Portoro%C5%BE/391006474295371). The food is just to die for, we are so sad that we discovered that place just 2 days before we left the hotel, wish we would have eaten there the whole week. The fish is just superb and steak just melts in your mouth. Wow!"
26.08.2013,4,"We stayed in this hotel twice. Both times we were very impressed by the architecture and how much the old and new work together. During our first stay we got a double room in the old part. It was quite spacious even with family it didn't feel stuffed. This year we got a bigger room in the new part and it was stunning with! We got a big balcony with a nice park and street/sea view. The rooms service does a great job.What we loved about this hotel most was the breakfast. First - it was offered until 12 pm and as late sleepers we enjoyed it very much. Second - the breakfast terrace is just gorgeous! And last but not least - the breakfast choice was great, a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh juices, lots of cereals, choice of different milk, pastry... There is just one thing I object- the kids area in the breakfast restaurant is situated next to the food bars which are quite far from the tables. We would appreciate a play area on the terrace so we can see the kids and the kids can see us. The hotel staff was very helpful and nice, we cannot complain at all.BUTAs written in the heading of the review, the 5star luxury lost the charm when the hotel was full. We were waiting for the pancakes for the kids for 30 - 40 minutes. The cook was nervous and snappy. The pool area was completely full. It is definitely too small for the size of the hotel. Since the beach and the sea in Portoroz is not very nice you choose the pool over the beach if you can. On the last day of our stay some technical problem occured and the pool area was closed. We were adviced to go the private beach but it was so full that there was no space for towels even on the concrete sidewalk. Nothnig luxurious about this beach, really. We chose to stay on the public beach and it was much better. This year we were also surprised that the beach area was not as clean as we expected from a five star hotel. We stayed at the sunbeds over the corner (not in the main pool area) and on the floor were stubs and dirt from other guests. There were also ""hidden"" broken sunbeds and umbrellas - somehow they forgot that there are still sunbeds for guests that are still occupied. We would still recommend the hotel but if you can, choose a low season to travel."
26.08.2013,3,"We stayed in the hotel for three nights. Even though the location and the architecture of the bulding itself are great, the quality of service was quite a bit of disappointment and certainly not at the level you would expect from a Kempinsky hotel. Maybe because the hotel was full, but breakfast table was difficult to get, coffee orders took half an hour to serve and breakfast staff (mostly interns?) looked very, very stressed each morning. Additionally, getting a place in the pool area was nearly impossible and the water was realy cold. One would normally not expect these hassles in this price range."
24.08.2013,1,"I am amused by people praising the hotel for its cleanliness. Yes, it was clean, but that's about it. I expect a bit more than ""just clean"" from Kempinski. The hotel was quite full so it may be part of the problem but such a brand should manage even at full capacity. Pool seats inaccessible, breakfast table 10min waiting time, eggs 25min waiting time, coffee 35min waiting time. Staff failed to mention that the Kempinski beach costs extra 20eur per person. Not a problem if you always carry a wallet but a bit of a pain if you walk there in your bathing suit and have to turn around. It's not that close. Also, considering you already pay 300+ eur, and it's a beach hotel, the beach could actually be included. Portoroz is quite ugly with lots of strange casino-junkies floating around. If you want nice, go to Piran, or even better, go somewhere else, to a more service-oriented country."
24.08.2013,5,"Really excellent hotel. I must say, that I was everywhere. In USA, Caribs, Maldives, Europe, Moscow, Africa ... This is the best hotel in my experience. Yes, it is expensive. But it is worthy of it. Really. I tried to connect DVD player to TV, but there were no connectors (inputs). I asked on reception and they told me: ""No problem, we will bring you next TV to your room"". And so on: for every (EVERY) request I got the answer ""No problem"" and it was solved in a minutes. Comfortable bed, invisible stuff. The best hotel in my life."
20.08.2013,5,"Great room, fantastic breakfast on a turn of the century terrace, most enjoyable swimming pool complement the sea.Impressive art exhibition of Donde, Stradivarirock made our stay more enjoyable.Walk and dinner in Piran is a must."
20.08.2013,5,Very very helpful and friendly staff. Wonderful and very clean rooms. Great breakfast. Good dinner and wisely planned terrace (you are above and away from the car noise and fumes) overseeing town and beach. Good car park for those traveling by bigger size car. Kids friendly.
17.08.2013,3,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.I stayed with my wife and 2 of my kids. Although we booked in advance the hotel was not able to book us 2 rooms on the same floor.For sure this hotel is a good hotel but claiming to be a 5 star luxury hotel you expect accommodation and service close to perfection.First of all the basics of a good hotel are he room and the bathroom. The room (we had a superior room) was ok and airco was working very nicely, housekeeping was excellent. The bathroom is one of the smallest bathrooms I have ever seen. It is about 2m? by 2m? with a bath, toilet and bidet all in the same space, Being with 2 persons in the bathroom is impossible. The bathroom has no shower. Unless you consider the hand sprinkler which is positioned in the bath at approximately 1m80 as a shower. Being taller than 6 feet I could sit on my knees washing my hair. When I complained about this to the reception asking them to buy a tube which is 15 centimeter longer, they told me I could take a normal shower at the spa.The bathroom being so small makes it a dangerous place. The door handle is rectangular (very nice art decco style) but with sharp edgy sides. I can not imagine how many people must have hurt themselves on this handles.Next basic in a hotel is the food.The breakfast is ok but far from outstanding. Some people may be overwhelmed by the champagne and strawberries but I prefer to get a cup of thee. Getting the thee was far more difficult. An antique looking water heather had to be filled with water constantly by staff. Which they only did when you asked for, during 4 days I had to ask 3 times and come back later 5 minutes to get some simple thee.In the evening you can eat at the lovely terasse in front of the hotel with ocean view. Except when too many people who are not staying at the hotel have made a reservation.They kindly say they are overbooked and you have to eat inside making you feel like second choice. It even gets worse when there is a wedding at the hotel. They put you in a place called gentleman's club which is not even listed as being one of the hotel restaurants.Besides these incidents the food was excellent. Except for the third day we only started to eat at 9 PM and got our main course around 10 PM. The risotto was overcooked and the turkey to dry. For sure due to the fact we were so late.... So one good advice start your diner no later than I would say 8 PM.The first day when we ate at the restaurant I had to ask specifically to get the wine card. The wine was overcharged and the average wine on the menu was around 100€. So we ordered an average local wine.The waiter did not let us taste the wine but immediately pored half of the bottle in 2 glasses.But I may sound negative so I repeat the food at the restaurant is excellent.Next basic element for an hotel is the swimming pool. Forget about the swimming pool. There are only about 80 sunbeds in this hotels and when at full capacity I believe 400 guests. So forget to get a sunbed unless you are an early bird willing to put your towels on the chairs early in the morning. In the hotel there are different warnings staff may take of your belongings from the sunbeds if yu are absent for more than 20 minutes. This only shows the importance of the problem and off course staaf never takes your belongings away. In for days we could only sit by the pool around 6 PM. this is a magic moment, people are leaving the swimming pool, you can start to understand why the designer wanted to make a tiny swimming pool. But 6 PM is also the time when the mosquito's start to be very active. Be sure to have some mosquito repellent protection or you will get nasty bites. And do not stay to long at the pool as you need to get in the restaurant preferably before 8 PM.No place at the swimming pool. No problem you can go to the 5 star luxury beach called Medusa. Only 150 m away from the hotel. As you are a guest of the hotel (4 other hotels give the same privilege) they only charge you 20€ per person. Most of the people in slovenia consider being at the beach as putting their towel on the concrete and getting a sun tan. So being on a sunbed on a small strip of grass (or something that looks like grass during the rain season) near the sea could be called a 5 star luxury beach and you feel privileged to pay only 20€. I have to say the grilled prawns i ate at the Medusa restaurant were excellent."
16.08.2013,4,"We arrived by car and was promptly greeted upon arrival. Check-in process went smoothly and our luggage as well as car was taken care of. The hotel have a beautiful interior, quite classical and not overwhelming. It suits the hotels architecture splendidly. We had booked a superior room with sea view. The room was on the 4th floor in the old building of the hotel. The size of the room was OK, dominated by the very pleasant bed. Room were clean and tidy upon arrival and it stayed so throughout our 4 night stay. We did indeed have a nice view of the Adriatic from our window, but more of that in a moment. There were an excellent breakfast buffet. The hotel was quite full, but we never had any problems finding a nice table out on the terrace. Waiters were busy, yet they were able to bring coffee promptly, and clean up tables when people left. We did not try any a la carte dishes for breakfast. We did spend some time by the pool which is salt water. We never had any problem getting sun beds. Service at the pool bar were good and prompt. We dined at both of the restaurants of the hotel, Fleur de Sel and Sophia, see separate reviews of them.The downside is Portoroz. From our view of the Adriatic we had to see over a shanty town of small restaurants, ice cream parlours and bars - some of them karaoke bars. Some of the bars played music till 3 o'clock in the morning, and although the sound isolation of our room was good, it was not possible to shut this music completely out. In fairness to Portoroz I must say that the sea looked very clean, and access to the sea was easy and free.It may be unfair to award this hotel 5 points because of things outside the control of the hotel in itself, but this was a part of our whole experience. The hotel in itself is however definitely worth 6 points."
14.08.2013,5,"This is by far the best hotel in Slovenia - I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is passing by. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable, the breakfast was amazing (lots of choice, from healthy options to indulging pancakes - fantastic!), and the staff are polite and friendly - worthy of the Kempinski name. I feel I can say this because I am Slovenian, but Slovenia is not known for its luxury and definitely lacks it, so coming across this hotel was like finding a needle in a haystack. I'll definitely be back."
13.08.2013,5,"Slovenia and Portoroz are well kept secrets in the United States market. The Kempinski palace was luxurious without feeling snobby. The staff were consistently friendly and always helpful. The food in the breakfast buffet and restaurants was excellent. Everything was spotless. The pool is beautiful and the area around it clean. The WIFI worked well. I found that Portoroz was ""user friendly"" as a tourist. Most people in the shops speak English. There are multiple gelato stands on the main drag. The view of the Adriatic from our room was picturesque. I am very allergic to mold and detected none in the hotel. AC worked well and there was a topper on the mattress making for a very comfortable bed."
13.08.2013,5,"An absolutely fantastic hotel, probably the best I have ever stayed on. Luxury feeling, beautiful builing. Very friendly staff, super attentive but not intrusive. Nice pool area. The restaurants are very good and the breakfast is spectacularly good."
3.08.2013,4,This apartment centre is just a perfect place to stay. It is close to everything and just 3 km from Piran which is a wonderful little fishing village. Get the bus to Piran as they do no permit cars to enter. Bus leaves from close to the marina complex. The apartments are very modern well serviced with all needed and air con. It is just 45 mins from Trieste airport and well worth a visit.
2.08.2013,5,"excellent hotel for holiday in Portoroz. Concierge is efficient and answers to all demand within a few minutes. Breakfast is generous with quality products. Staff is helpful and kind. Clientele is casual. The beach is 200 meters apart from the hotel, it is, in fact, a paved pier with a grass area. There is room enough for everybody and even if it is a little expensive it is worth the price. Service is efficient in the beach area. The salted pool is big enough and service around it efficient too. A place to go if you like riviera's cities in the adriatic."
31.07.2013,5,"The Kempinski is a brand new facility, with excellent service, and close to the beach. The food and service were also very good in the formal restaurant. We had an excellent stay, and can think of nothing that we would change."
29.07.2013,5,"Will start with the not so good..no direct beach access and crowded pool.But those are about the only bad things i can come up with.Main restaurant is really good,as we stayed there for 6 days i was a bit concerned about the menu,it seemed a little limited.This in fact was not the case,every day the manager Mr Stojan Babic would have new suggestions for us.And even beyond that,some of us just explained what we would like and the chef would try and create that for us.Also had some lunch at Fleur de Sel and that was excellent aswell,really friendly staff,very helpfull[thank you Daniel,Joe and Winnie]All in all a very nice place,maybe less so for those who really want peace and quiet."
26.07.2013,5,Just what we need after a busy time at a Romanian wedding and time on the road. We were given a lovely room (422) with a large balcony overlooking the sea. Masses of space with all you would expect except a kettle. The breakfasts were wonderful - everything you could possible think of and more - champagne & strawberries - and served until 12 noon! Our classic car was safely stored in the underground car park but disgraced himself by letting out bad smells and setting off the pollution alarm.
25.07.2013,5,"Beautifully restored old Palace hotel is probably one of the most splendor on Slovenian cost. Hotel consists of 2 parts: old Palace part with a lot of patina and a new building. I stayed in the old part in a deluxe room with excellent bed and luxurious bathroom. The room was not as spacious as I expected, but it was tastefully furnished. Breakfast is served on a beautiful terrace overlooking the garden of the Palace and the experience sitting there was just perfect. The good thing is the breakfast is served until noon. The pool is nice, with whirlpool on side, not very big, but you can swim yourself quite good. Con: hotel doesn't possess its own, private beach. There is also no direct access to it. You can go to a nearby Meduza beach which is shared with other Portoroz hotels and has entrance fee. From that reason the hotel is not suitable for longer summer holiday and for beach lovers, who would like to have more privacy and luxurious feeling as a Kempinski guest also on the beach."
22.07.2013,5,"We spent 3 nights in the hotel mid July. We experienced great service and an excellent room, nevertheless bathroom is at the smaller end. Pool area is also nice, but relatively small - compared to the size of the hotel. The only con is the lack of direct beach access and the lack of a kempinski beach section. There is a joint beach section for all of the five star hotels, but you have to pay an extra eur 15 pp. Since the sea is not nice in portoroz, we stayed most of the time at the pool area. Breakfast is great and you can enjoy it until 12!!!"
17.07.2013,4,"very classy place, nice professional staff, big rooms , nice big terrace to have your breakfast with excellent variety and high quality of foods.may be 2 bad points to mention, the pool is too small comparing to the very big number of rooms the hotel has , but you can still manage to find sunbeds, but the hotel has no beach.there were no tea/coffee maker in the room ( while in such hotels it must be part of the room amenities, some of them have nespresso machine in each room ) and when i asked for a kettle they said no for security reasons , I an still curious to know what do they mean by security reasons and explain it to me and to the thousands of hotels who are offering the tea/coffee maker in room....."
13.07.2013,5,"We have been here on our honeymoon, and we had great Services!The concierge was very helpful, they recommended us very good restauants; At the breakfast we could eat tasteful cheeses and Italian bacons. The view is wonderful"
10.07.2013,2,"We had 4 rooms and it's our second visit and the last one!We travel a lot and often to kempinski around the world , and never found something like this..There it's so much to say, I'm not gonna make a story about this , I'll just put the goods and bads .GoodsConsierge and choffeour , attentive and willing to help.The Sophia restaurant , nice stuff very nice foods , too limited selectionThe breakfast personnel .Bads I call reception for Cleanning my room because they forgot and they answered me ,at 10 pm that this it's how they do it in this hotel! Her tone of voice was categoric and not at all friendly! Next time I called she answered with ""now what""... I couldn't believe it!!At the pool you can dehydrate because u cannot get a drink until u go to the lifeguard to ask him to get u a waiter for the pool bar ironically opened but without bartender , and if you are lucky he may find somebody from the restaurant willing to come.. I wasn't lucky every day so I had to go to back up solutions in the street to buy myself a bottle of water.Once I ordered a penne Bolognese at the pool bar, for my child and a upset waiter came with the penne, I asked her some parmigiano and she told me that they don't have! And it was hard enough to get the penne from the room service, I insisted that maybe room service may have some parmigiano and she looked at me even more annoyed , finally agreeing to ask them!! Pointless to say that when the little one was full we've got some parmigiano ...In the rooms they don't give water for turn down service, anyway this service doesn't always happen..I had to wake up at 7 every morning to get a bed at the pool but this it's not entirely their fault..In the first day the pool water was ice cold, I asked the pool person what happen and he told me that some mechanic part it's currently broken, I've asked him how long will that take to fix it he was just hopefully that during our staying!I was very surprised to see the restaurant above the pool , opened for lunch, dirty with the tables full of dust, not set for lunch at all, at first I've got the impression that they are closed! Ofcourse always empty !We had few lunches there, the service was good, ( maybe brcause we were the only table)but the chef it's not the best!We ordered one hamburger for the kid, they burned it out on one side and after covering that part with sauce they served it like that! I couldn't cut it ! How can the chef release a plate like that in a 5 star hotel restaurant .. I don't know!Do not do dry Cleanning , laundry.I did, and aprouved them to try to clean 3 little stains they told me they found!! I didn't even know about them wire the trousers for for second time,nor about the consequence of my approval !The trousers came back with big stains of clour on both legs, when I complained I've been humiliated by the girl in charge , in the lobby with people looking at us while she was explaining to me that it's my fault, they asked me in advance , she was holding up the trousers and speaking loud until I just couldn't listen to the circus anymore and I gave up...There are more like this but I'll stop here just for you to have an idea of what can happen in this hotel 100% full!!"
23.06.2013,5,"I stayed with my wife and our two friends to celebrate a birthday. From the moment we walked into the hotel until we left, the staff made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The hotel restaurant is top notch, the staff is knowledgable about the food and wine, and the kitchen prepared the food perfectly. The entire weekend stay was not cheap, but we would spend every penny again for such a great experience."
19.06.2013,4,"We were drawn to the beautiful Adriatic in this area and this hotel did not disappoint. It is everything it promises to be as a Kempinksi. Friendly, accommodating service (especially friendly when you consider the overall ""service"" in Slovenia), modern bathrooms, very comfortable beds, and an awesome buffet breakfast as others have commented on. Parking fee includes unlimited valet parking. If you are relying on your mobile device to get you there, don't follow the English directions in google maps - the second one in Slovenian is correct. (We have put in a correction request to Google so this may be rectified). Our interconnecting rooms were in the new section (nice and new) and had a partial sea view from a nice balcony. We enjoyed exploring Piran more than Portoroz (which is a very touristy beach town)."
2.06.2013,2,"What a wonderful and rare opportunity to stay in such a magnificiant historical place. Staff was ok, rooms were nice. Food was generally good. The hk stuff did not speak english at all or very poor. The main hotel seemed better, but not 5 star. Would not go again."
31.05.2013,5,"This establishment is 5 star in every respect, position, staff, service, quality of food and quality of bedding.It is apparent that each member of staff is trained to give guests complete satisfaction."
30.05.2013,5,"Portoroz is a medium seaside town close to Piran. Too much concrete and no old town but If you want to discover not only the Slovenian coast, but also the Western part of Slovenia, Portoroz is an excellent base to do so and the Kempinski Palace is the best in Portoroz (no competition) and probably in Slovenia. Everything from the location to the staff to the rooms to the breakfast etc etc is just top notch. Don't hesitate to book a room here."
21.05.2013,5,A very nice hotel on the slovenian coast. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are superclean and i would recommend it for the value of a nice view on the coast. I like the park in front of the hotel. Definitely would go back.
20.05.2013,4,"Very good hotel, the location, the service, the food Rooms are very comfortableIt's also got 2 swiming pool with salted water, original and very relaxingFree wifi or included in the price it's a little plus that counts"
17.05.2013,4,"we spent here few weekends when we needed to take a rest and just switched off. it was the best decision to chose Kempinski. The stuff was very friendly and helpful. My doggie was treated very nice. Hotel is based in old building and it brings you the feeling of history. Small park in front the hotel was a good choice. Breakfast- one of the best i ever seen ( we are still remembering ""the brekafast in Portoroz"") Portoroz as city is not offering a lot so we went for dinners and night life in Piran."
7.05.2013,4,"Very nice hotel with a high level of comfort. Big balconies and an extremely nice pool. The hotel is located at the sea side. We had two Superior rooms connecting and it worked very well with all 4 kids. The breakfast was fantastic. Well functioning wifi included in the price. Some decoration would need an update, but we were very pleased and will come back."
4.05.2013,5,"Spent here great Easter time with friends! First of all, I would like to thank personally great service by Anja and Pierre at the restaurant and all the guys at the concierce, specially Kristjan.+ great rooms on the newer side, big balcony, shower & bath both in the toilet+ very nice rooms on the older side, completely different style but really ok. smaller balcony though+ nice pool area+ very good treatments in the spa+ excellent breakfast, also Easter dinner was good+ valet parking+ great guys at the concierge+ shuttle service at low cost to Piran, casino etc..+ nice central location at Portoroz, 100m from the beach+ late breakfast- promised sparkling wine didnt arrive upon arrival, even after two calls. after 40min of waiting gave up- German style reserving of the seats at the pool area very annoying. pool guys could spend more attention that people wouldnt reserver chairs whilst they go for dinner or smtWould like to return immediately!"
21.04.2013,3,"I just stayed 3 nights at the Kempinksi Portoroz (I had to be in the area for a meeting). Let me introduce myself as a seasoned traveler who has stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels of the world. When travelling, I like to pick my hotels by using websites such as Kiwicollection, Conde Nast magazine, Travel & Leisure (see my other reviews). So I only like the best of the best. This is a very nice hotel, a former palace transformed into a modern, luxurious hotel. While it probably is the best hotel of Slovenia, I would not consider it a destination hotel in its own. Stay there when you have to be in the area. Things that I did like a lot :- The hotel is composed of an older palace building, and a new modern wing. It feels very airy and the décor is very nicely done. - the staff was very friendly and very helpful. Thanks to all of them. They are doing a great job.- the rooms are very large, modern, and tastefully decorated. - breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing (one of the best I ever witnessed in a hotel) and the buffet was open until noon every day (so you can have more of a brunch instead of breakfast)- I had dinner at the hotel twice. The food was good (not great) but the service was excellent and very charming.Things that I did not like that much (& suggestions for the owners) :- Portoroz is not really an interesting town. It has no beach, and not charm to speak off. I have to admit that nearby Piran is very nice though and worth a visit if you are in the area. - a street is running between the hotel and the waterfront (so the hotel has no waterfront location). This is of course something you should know upfront, as the hotel website makes this very clear.- the swimming pool contains salt water & the hot tube near the inside pool was not a hot tube at all as the water was almost cold. In addition, the floors near the pools (both inside and outside) are very slippery when wet, so take care and always wear slippers. - The airco in my room somehow was defective. When you want your room temperature to be lower than 20°C, you have to call the reception, who will arrange that from their desk. However, while the airco indicated a room temperature of 17°C, it was still very hot.- my airport shuttle left at 2 pm. I asked whether I could have the room for an additional 2 hours (check-out is noon) and I was told that that was possible but at an extra charge. That was a first to me as I never encountered this policy at a Four Seasons, St Regis, Banyan Tree, Raffles, Rosewood or other luxury chain. It is hotel policy apparently, but somewhat left a sour taste.Verdict : without any doubt the best hotel of Slovenia, but only bother staying there when you have to be in the area."
7.04.2013,4,"I had a business trip there for a conference. I stay there two nights. The hotel and the spa is very elegant and pleasant.The food were excellent, but the hotel atmosphere also very good. The location is good, it is not far from the beach, ( 300m only)."
31.03.2013,5,"Beautiful hotel, well trained staff, excellent food and service, relaxing spa and pool, wonderful view, modern rooms....I could stay forever :-)Place where u can charge your batteries, for sure!Good located. We were with 22 months old daughter, and she was sad when we start to pack to go home :-)She said to me: mam, it is so beautiful!"
19.03.2013,5,"beautiful hotel, you are feeling in a modern place. the SPA is very pleasant. very good cocktails at the bar and nice terrasses to stay. the bedroom was very pleasant too, everything clean and nice designed. local staff was very friendly."
19.01.2013,5,"Wow, what an amazing hotel. From the moment you check-in to the sad time you check-out everything is perfect. We got lucky and were upgraded to one of their suites which was just stunning with a beautiful view of the sea. The breakfast was out of this world. You could eat anything you practically imagine, all in a beautiful setting. One evening we went out to dinner, but had to come back because I forgot something. As I was walking out of the hotel the receptionist says, “Don’t worry I’ve already called the restaurant and told them that you’d be late.” I never told them to call! That’s service."
9.01.2013,5,"My wife and I stayed here in August and absolutely loved the Hotel. The service, location, and overall experience was really top-notch. One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is in the process of being renovated and that there are some rooms that are much, much nicer and newer than others. We had some friends that stayed on another floor (rooms were about the same price) and their room was not nearly as nice as ours. In addition, if you can get a room with a view of the water, I'd highly recommend it.The only negative thing I can say is that the room thermostat would not go below 18 degrees Celsius, which was just a little too warm for us. With a simple call to the front desk they ""unlocked"" it and it was instantly able to be turned down to a lower temperature. So if you find the climate is too hot or too cold, it may help to ask the front desk if they can adjust the thermostat settings.Overall, I'd highly recommend the hotel and Portoroz overall as a place to visit."
7.01.2013,5,"We spent a week at the Kempinski in September 2012 for our wedding! It was beyond incredible! The service was impecable and the hotel staff could not have been nicer. The hotel is absolutely beautiful -- the rooms are large and beautifully decorated (both on the modern side and the classic side of the hotel). The hotel pool is wonderful and a great place to spend the day relaxing! The crystal ball-room is stunning and looks like it belongs in a James Bond movie. The hotel is right across the street from a beautiful beach and great restaurants and night life. A short walk or a few minutes cab ride will take you to the beatiful old town of Piran.What makes this hotel so special is the outstanding service. The entire staff knows your name, what you like to eat, and even remembers how you like your coffee. All of our guests couldn't stop talking about the amazing service they recieved during their stay. You really feel like royalty! The Kemponski Portoroz is one of the most special hotels we have ever stayed in. We are frequent travelers and are comparing it against other 5 star plus hotels. The architecture is magnificent (this is a palace afterall). Each room in the hotel (from the lobby to the ballroom, to the bar, to the restaurants) are unique. They have perfectly mixed modern and classic design in a very tasteful way.The food is phenominal -- especially the gourmet breakfast included in your stay. Everyone at our wedding could not stop talking about the breakfast and how amazing it was. Hands down the best breakfast we have ever had (including Tuscany and Sonoma). You get to sit on the terrace each morning with a view of the ocean. Hard to beat!I give this hotel my highest recommendation. And...if you are thinking of holding your wedding there I would strongly recommend it! Feel free to message me with any questions about planning your wedding or next trip there. I can also recommend a phenominal photographer and event planner."
29.12.2012,2,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Kempinski. Since November is very low season, especially so during mid-week, there were of course not many guests. The building is newish and we had a nice junior suite facing the sea. Unfortunately, service was dreadful. Since it was getting cold in the evening, we were surprised that the air con was only cooling. No chance to reach anyone by phone, we tried several times on different numbers. Finally, I went to the reception myself. The totally incompetent receptionnist had 'by mistake' turned off her phone and there was nobody else on duty... She told me that it was not so cold yet and that's why they had not yet changed the aircon to winter (heating) mode. Only when I insisted that for 300plus Euros per night we would not want to freeze, did she reluctantly agree to send someone from maintenance. When the guy turned up, it took him over an hour to fix the aircon. Breakfast was also absolutely sub-par both mornings of our stay. The buffet was big, but quality was very mediocre. Also, service was not friendly at all. Last but not least the valet parking was not working properly. We had to wait evey time , and not just a few minutes. This hotel claims to be the only 5 star property in Slovenia, but we have stayed at several much better hotels in that country. I will not be back to Kempinski for sure."
26.12.2012,5,"We stayed twice here in quick succession, as part of a break during a business related journey, which already provides a good clue.While checking out the first time, we were asked how we enjoyed our stay, I answered 9/10, and the receptionist asked why not 9? The lack of a thermostatic valve on the shower was the main reason, plus the battery was dead in the bathroom scales ( a very minor point). The receptionist noted these comments onto their computer system, We were both impressed by all of this. I am cynical enough to suspect that most hotels never take action on most such feedback, but got the distinct feeling that the Kempinsky were listening and would take action.The first stay was in a superior room, with sea view, in the older part of the hotel.Our second stay was in a standard room, with ""park view"" and without sea view, in the new part of the hotel. There was a more modern bathroom, with thermostatic shower valve. Next time, we will ask for a similar room.The only fault I could pick is the lack of fresh raspberries with breakfast, so my rating was 9.9/10 ( I don't like allocating a perfect 10).Breakfast is served until 12 midday, and was probably the best hotel breakfast we have experienced, in both quality and variety. Unlimited espresso and cappuccino coffee could be ordered, and real champagne was also available, and included.The swimming pool and spa area was very good, although Health and Safety might worry about some slippery surfaces, and also electric cables crossing the doorway to the outside catering area. (I am nit-picking).Probably the best feature of the experience was that all the staff appeared happy, and always polite and very helpful. Other hotels should send their new staff here for training.The location is very good, the climate and weather added to the positive experience. Our lasting impression was that this is the best hotel we have yet stayed at. We are trying to think of an excuse to return sooner rather than later."
19.12.2012,5,wonderful five stars hotel overlooking the bay. The whole hotel is very stylish. The old building is very beautiful. We had a room in the new building. Room was modern and large with very comfortable bed and softness bedding. Free WiFi. Excellent buffet breakfast served in a ball hall untill noon.
4.12.2012,5,"I stayed here in early October with my husband. Our room was lovely, with a balcony that faced to water. The staff was helpful and kind, and everyone spoke English well. Our room had a large bathroom with a nice sized soaking tub that I was able to enjoy. Room service was efficient, and the brunch in the morning was beautiful and abundant. We would love to go back!"
19.11.2012,4,"The hotel is fully renovated 4 years ago and there are no cracks of time to be seen. The design is not everybody’s taste. Not mine...a very extravagant mixture of Austro Hungarian base and ""want to be expensive"" contemporary design. Too glamorous actually. The best thing is the bath, spacey and practical.Breakfasts are great; the best thing is that they are served until 12. Swimming pool and spa area not 5 stars, sauna is in stone and you can hear every voice, Italians (as usually) shout and enter the sauna in bath suits and stare at naked people. For a spa experience you would be probably better in Terme & Wellness LifeClass.Location and stuff great.Yes, I did enjoy it but also paid the price for it, and it wasn't low...."
17.11.2012,5,"By almost all standards this is a true 5-star hotel. We spent one night in November 2012 and had a great experience there. Service is excellent, professional and thoughtful. I had left my iPod in the car and the valet driver took the initiative to bring it back to the room. Front desk staff was also very friendly and efficient. However, what makes the Kempinski Palace Hotel remarkable is how a run-down property has been turned into a modern, sleek and stylish hotel. Much has been done to keep as many features as possible from the original building and the result is sometimes stunning such as in the Sofia restaurant or in the breakfast room. A modern building has been added to the original one and although both could not be more different much attention has been given to have them combine in the best possible way. Rooms are extremely comfortable with everything that can be expected in a 5-star hotel plus a touch of originality such as the bright colored rococo armchairs. The indoor pool and the spa are excellent. We had dinner at the hotel (Sofia restaurant) and although there was not much to complain about we were a little bit disappointed. Given the excellence of the hotel and its services we would have expected something less ordinary. Wonderful breakfast with a great variety of juices, breads and pastries. Overall, Kempinski Palace Hotel offers high quality services and lives up to its 5 stars."
17.11.2012,5,"World Class Hotel with fantastic rooms, spa and food. The breakfast alone is a reason to stay at the hotel. Outstanding. And having the breakfast at the terrace with the adriatic see just outside is fantastic. The Spa is also fantastic. Not a cheep hotel but well worth the money !"
16.11.2012,5,"Champagne at breakie, caviar on toast, now that's my sort of hotel. Stayed for a week, and totally enjoyed the hotel, and the village. AND the locals.Had some extra charges on my CC, but they were promptly sorted.My first Kempinski experience, but now where ever I travel I keep an eye out for one."
7.11.2012,3,"Very nice and comfortable rooms. The old building is beautiful. Breakfast is served in a nice ball room and has great variety and high standard. Stayed for four nights and ordered room service few times. if you can try to avoid ordering the food as it is horrible! All of the dishes were either undercooked or lacked seasoning, even potatoes were raw, risotto was tasteless, spagetti not salted. Don't even think of ordering their soups as you will for sure not be able to swallow even one drop."
5.11.2012,5,"Marvelous place in where stay in relax with your dear, family or business. majestic, clean, top level hotel with all services. Personals are ready and kindy with all customers. Swimming pool, Sauna, and Spa High Level."
27.10.2012,5,It was our first night in slovenia .it was nice we stayed interconnegted rooms with the children it has nice spa and pools . But sauna was shocked me . You can not get in with.short or anything it was so silly .
22.10.2012,5,"Stayed for just one night while traveling throughout the region but what an excellent one night it was! Kempinski always does a fine job! Staff was very nice and helpful. Room was large, modern and sparkling clean! Good location. Would definitely stay again if returning to the area!"
19.10.2012,5,"We were only in town for one night here. The service, comfort and view was fantastic. The real stand out for us was the help they offered when we forgot our phone in the room. They quickly shipped the phone to our next destination at no charge, helping us greatly. Aside from this situation, we were very happy to find this hotel, it was perfect."
15.10.2012,4,"I stayed here one night. Pros: The hotel is superbly located. Service level is impeccable. Room is nicely furnished, bed firmness and bedding softness are perfect. Noise level (in the garden view room of the traditional part of the hotel) is zero, which made for perfectly undisturbed sleep.Cons: The breakfast selection is mediocre considering the hotel rating. Some local guests complain that some staff members don't speak slovenian. Valet parking isn't complimentary."
13.10.2012,4,"We stayed here for just one night whilst traveling around Slovenia. The hotel is typical of it's type very well appointed, superb rooms, excellent buffet breakfast, free WiFi and it's in a very good location. The price is reasonable, however paying extra to park the car I thought was a bit excessive. When we return to this lovely country again we will definitely stay at this hotel and explore the area in more detail."
7.10.2012,5,"We stayed for just one night, but the overall impression is extremly satisfying. The room was in the old building, it was huge and nicely furnished. The bed was very, very large :) and we slept like kings. We had breakfast on the terrace which overlooks the Portoroz beach and it was excellent, plenty of choices and immaculate staff.Definitely would like to come back for a longer stay."
2.10.2012,5,"Stayed here while attending a 2 day conference. An absolutely fantastic location. Hotel consists of a new and old building although it's difficult to tell from the inside. I had a room in the new building which was very modern, stylish, large and very well appointed. It has a very nice pool area although I didn't get to use the leisure and spa facilities which looked amazing. Over the road you'll find shops, bars and restaurants none of which were that busy even on a Thursday/Friday night but I put that down to being end of season.Several bars ara available in the hotel, breakfast was excellent as was lunch. Ate too much but it was all very good as you would expect from a Kempinski."
1.10.2012,4,"Very nice and modern hotel. It consists of a new and old building. We had our room in the new building. But never the less the whole hotel is very modern and stylisch. It has a very nice indoor pool area. Over the Street are shops and Restaurants. Internet is free, parking not."
1.10.2012,5,"We had a very nice room in the new section of the hotel overlooking the sea. The room, bathroom, and balcony were modern, clean, and spacious. The service was great. The breakfast had plenty of choices and served until noon! We would like to come back."
30.09.2012,5,"Our third stay at a Kempinski Hotel and (again) loved it. The “usual” comforts of a luxury hotel, very nice rooms, great view of the sea (if you book sea-view...), VERY attentive service and a very nice Spa, Sauna and pool area. The best was breakfast: an amazing selection and they serve it until 12:00 noon!Now they could have told us that the one of the restaurants had a private function and was thus closed instead of recommending (twice!) that we should have dinner there and do a better job in keeping the area around the pool drier (one guest slipped badly), but otherwise no complaints."
26.09.2012,2,"This is wonderful five star hotel overlooking the bay - pity the staff cannot be trusted. Room price was very reasonable - 130 euros for a double room with breakfast was good I thought. The breakfast had a good range of continental choices like cold meats, cheese and a variety of breads. For the Anglo Americans there was the usual scrambled eggs, toast, bacon and sausages. One could also have an omlette made to order - nice touch. There was also a good selection of international newspapers to choose from.The bathroom and bedroom were amazing - see attached photos.They have a valet service to park the car (car parking fees of 18 euros a night) but I was disappointed that the valet who parked my car stole the loose change I had left in the vehicle. I did not find out till I reached for the change at the toll booth only to find I had been cleaned out. I did call the hotel and complain to the manager but I doubt anthing will come of it. Luckily my mp3 player and sun glasses were not swiped from the car as well!"
26.09.2012,4,"The Kempinski Palace seemed to be the nicest hotel in Portoroz. The setting is gorgeous (although not where you want to go if you are looking for sandy beaches). There were some spots where they had brought sand in, but where the land meets water, it's like a cement boardwalk that goes right into water that is often like a foot or two deep. The hotel is very conveniently located, and there is a great car rental place across the road. Driving is easy in Slovenia, and car rentals are inexpensive.The rooms were really nice, although we ended up in the newer section of the hotel, which didn't seem like it was as nice as the older section, so it might be good to ask for a room in the old part of the hotel. The breakfasts were really delicious, and the staff is very courteous. In general, the people we encountered in Slovenia seemed to generally want you to have a great stay in their country. It's a great spot to go because everything is so close! Slovenia has amazing things to see, all within a short drive. At the end of our stay, we took a 2 hour train ride to Venice and stayed there for a few nights, as well.The Spa at the hotel was pretty expensive, but there was a far less expensive one right next door, so I would suggest that one. The bed was really comfortable, the balcony was nice and spacious. Of the things we saw and did in Slovenia, I would say that the must sees are as follows:Lake BledThe caves (we went to two, which were completely different from eachother, and each was amazing!)Lipizzaner stallionsCroatian town of MotovunLjubliana"
24.09.2012,5,"On the shores of the Adriatic, it is a beautiful hotel with excellent rooms and great service.We stayed in early June before the main season the price was very reasonable but it becomes very expensive later in the summer.The town is a small seaside resort with not much to do but there is quite a bit nearby in Piran and further afield if you are driving (don't forget to get a motorway vignette before you start driving as they watch out for tourists)."
23.09.2012,4,"Stayed here 14th - 16th September 2012. Very impressive building - inside and out. On arrival my only disappointment was that we did not have a sea view, and after enquiring at reception were told that there were no spare rooms at the front.Our bedroom was in the old part of the hotel, very classic decorations. Large room, with a very large and comfy bed, pillows were very comfy too. Bathroom very nice and clean and lots of nice touches like a weighing scale (not that I used it!!!), bath took a little while to fill-up. I was a bit surprised that there was not a tea/coffee making facilities, only a complimentary small bottle of water. Nice large, soft and thick towels.Enjoyed our breakfast on the terrace - although I do like buffet breakfast, it is sometimes nice to be waited on. The breakfast room with the chandeliers and white furnishings are really beautiful.We had evening dinner with our company colleagues, the service was impeccable - hardly noticed the waiters and my wine glass never seemed to empty! Did not really like the fish soup - a piece of fish floating still with its skin intact was quite off-putting!All-in-all a lovely stay at the Palace hotel - would certainly think about returning again one day!"
17.09.2012,5,"We stayed at the Kempinski Palace for 4 nights at the start of our honeymoon in August and had such a wonderful stay there. The staff was so amenable and friendly and nothing was too much for them. When our hire car gave up the ghost and the company responsible refused to do anything about it, it was the concierge who kept on ringing for hours to try to sort the situation out, and that was after we'd checked out. We had a deluxe room with a sea view in the old part of the hotel, which was well worth the extra. The room was huge, with a gorgeous bathroom with a jacuzzi bath and his 'n' hers sinks. The bed was longer and wider than my 6' husband! The view was sensational, so we decided to treat ourselves to breakfast on our balcony one morning, which was exquisite. Silver service and set out beautifully. They must have realised also that it was my birthday, and I returned to find Sekt on ice in our room, which was a lovely surprise. The breakfast room was very grand and the terrace where people mostly ate was just lovely. I have never had such a variety of foods for breakfast. There was truly something for every palate, and all incredibly fresh and appetising. The only thing that wasn't 5* was the guests themselves! Probably the most stuck up miserable looking guests I have ever seen, but that's probably because they were used to the 5* luxury and not impressed by all the things that wowed us mere mortals. They didn't spoil it though!It was just whaty we wanted to kick start our honeymoon; a touch of luxury married perfeclty with the elegance of days gone by."
12.09.2012,5,We stayed in this hotel this summer. Hotel is just perfect. Great spa with very good cosmetic nice swimming pool. The room could be a bit better but we stayed in old part and had balcony so I think it is depend in which building you are staying. The have very nice breakfast room. Staff are working fast. I enjoyed my few day in this hotel and definitely would recommend this hotel.
4.09.2012,5,"I just returned from an absolutely amazing week at the Kempinski Palace. I have stayed at several luxury hotels and this hotel is truly one of the best. Rooms:The rooms are large and beautiful, both the traditional side and the modern side. The rooms are very different but offer the same amenities. The bathrooms are large and beautiful. Each room has both a shower and bathtub. The modern side rooms look like the W hotel in the United States. Each room has a balcony. One thing to note is that the hotels in Portoroz don't have irons in the rooms. The Kempinski has their own service and does a great job cleaning/ironing. Pool:The pool is fabulous, it's a mix of las vegas modern and fun with Ritz Carlton luxury. Food and drinks at the pool were great and they even have pool movie nights, which seemed like a lot of fun. Nejc was great at the pool and treated all of us very well. Food: The breakfast buffet is included in the price of the room but I would have paid extra, it was so amazing. They had an omelet/egg station, the most delicious granola, cold cuts, cheese, and lots of bakery items. It was fabulous! You can sit outside on the terrace and enjoy coffee and breakfast. The dinners were fantastic as well, fresh fish, pasta, soups....all were great. Service: The service was the best I have experienced. It was at the level of the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, maybe better. Each staff member was courteous, helpful and made you feel special. Luca at the front desk was great. Thomas and Aleks were wonderful! They both went above and beyond to make our stay so fabulous. Internet: There is free wireless internet throughout the entire hotel. Amazing!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Slovenia. It is the epitome of european luxury and class. I can't wait to go back! One more thank you to Aleks, who made every request we had possible."
4.09.2012,5,Superb hotel if you're looking for some luxury in the area. It's right across the road from the adriatic sea with great facilities. I have not see any other hotel as grand in the area and the staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating. I strongly recommend it if you are planning to come down to Piran and Portoroz!
4.09.2012,5,"This is truly a great place to stay. The staff was very helpful, and view of the Adriatic Sea is breathtaking, the hotel pool is salt water and pristine, with lots of loungers and good bar service. The room was spacious, clean and well decorated. We stayed in the older part and have no complains. Breakfast is incredible and a great start to the day!The area around the hotel is great for evening walks and the best gelatos, just across the street at Cacao's. Piran is not to far (10 min by cab) and if you like seafood, that's your place!"
27.08.2012,5,"The hotel is simpley fantastic like a palace!The rooms are large and nicely decorated, modern and with balcony.For breakfast offering large selection of meals..... also local ones.... breakfast terrace with fantastic view.Pool is very nice with sea water and fantastic sunbeds (limited).In the evenings pool operating as a garden cinema.Staff is more than professional."
26.08.2012,4,"I stayed in this hotel for third time this year and i am absolutly terified with the situation here, in high season period. Cleanless in pool area is worse then you can imagine, sunbeds are dirty, also floor is constantly wet and dirty. Other services in this hotel are good, but the experience from the pool area ... I will never come again... No value for the money... If you want to spent a few days in this area, choose the kempinski in savudria, it is near by, and much more better than this in portoroz (except the kitchen, it is fabulous here, but you can make a trip here for dinner). Or come on jun or september, when the hotel is empty and the staff is able to do their job (btw only one person from staff is here to take care about poll area- is it enough? I'm sure it is not, mr. Manager)."
24.08.2012,5,"After a eventful and exhausting 5 days of hiking in the Slovenian mountains, we tool a two days break at the Kempinski.We stayed in the refurbished wing, just above the swimming poolAnd it was there that it struck me how some hotels are definitely overrated.This is not the case for the Kempinski at Portoroz. They really earned and deserve their 5 stars.We were extremely pleased bu the experience.The personal is extremely friendly, polite and helpful.The accommodations, i.e. rooms, spa, bar, etc... are top notch.Last but not least, the food is exquisite.Would I return ? Definitely yes !"
21.08.2012,5,"My husband and I stayed for a week at the Kempinski Palace at the end of July. The Kempinski Palace in Portoroz is a 5-star hotel by definition. It really is a grand, beautiful structure (an old palace) on the outside that has been completely updated with all the modern amenities. Our room was on the ""Palace"" side of the hotel and we found it to be light, bright, and spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable! My only complaint about the room would be that the shower temperature seemed to fluctuate frequently - not a big deal, though. Our room was promptly serviced everyday in a very unobstrusive way. The pool and the common areas of this hotel were top notch. However, my most favorite part about staying at this hotel had to be the breakfast every morning. The breakfast - by far - is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. What an amazing spread of fresh pastries, fruits, juices, preserves, meats and cheeses - not to mention a made to order omelet and waffle line with breakfast meats and other specialties! You really must try the homemade cereals - I had this every day and I loved it. If the food isn't enough - the setting on the outdoor terrace is stunning! I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate to recommend it!"
19.08.2012,5,This is a true five star resort. It was beautiful inside and out. The best in portoroz. Their morning brunch on the terrace was lovely and the omlettes very good. The croussants were also pretty yummy! Ask for a sea front room. If your air conditioning doesn't get cool enough ask and they will turn it down to 16 deg celsius. They don't have the same ac standards as united states. Lovely salt water pool with jets and my 30 min massage was also very relaxing. This resort has a very classy staff and the grounds top notch. FYI....added plus most people at hotel speak very good English so no worries! Nice little mini mart one block to the right of the hotel if you are looking at the front of the hotel.
13.08.2012,5,"Two years ago my wife and I spent part of our honeymoon at this lovely property. This weekend we came back and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel has blossomed. The service its now spot on; everything is done in a very pleasant and unobtrusive manner. The staff is also quite knowledgeable about the area...restaurants, ect. Like most posts already state the breakfast is superb. Kempinski Portoroz provides a perfect platform for a very relaxing, memorable holiday. To top it all off we were checked out of the hotel by Dragan who was the one to welcome us when we came for our honeymoon two years ago. It is people like Dragan that take a hotel from being good to being a place where great memories are made. We will surely come back again...hopefully very soon."
12.08.2012,5,"Every experience at Kempinski Palace was top notch. The bed was very comfortable with a variety of pillow options. The pool, although salt water, was great to have an indoor and outdoor option. Beware, the hot tub is not hot, according to American standards. Breakfast on the terrace is one of the finest we have ever experienced. The honey, dripping from the honeycomb, is a special touch. If you are planning to rent a car, work with Sixt rental agency. They partner with Kempinski, so you can drop off after hours with the concierge at no additional charge. Water is provided in the room, but not always daily. We didn't love the town of Portoroz (not as resort feeling as expected, crowded, and somewhat dirty) we did LOVE the country of Slovenia and Kempinski. Definitely take day trips to see the rest of the country. We will return to the Kempinski Palace and Slovenia again!"
12.08.2012,5,"We have just spent a week at this hotel to celebrate our anniversary and were extremely impressed with every aspect of this beautiful hotel. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe seaview room which was spacious, modern and beautiful. The public areas, the pool and the breakfast were all truly first class, Staff are attentive and having stayed at many other five star hotels throughout Europe and USA, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. We will definitely return."
9.08.2012,3,"The bathroom had no shower curtains/cabin and everything got really wet. Not to mention the really strange toilet shape, which was totally uncomfortable for men. It was also impossible to raise the toilet seat."
9.08.2012,4,"The hotel itself occupies the prime location in Portoroz, which it proudly deserves with its fantastic turn of the century architecture. The renovation just kept the facade. Inside it's completely new. The hotel appears to have the Kempinski standard, clean, modern and efficient. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, with a superb air-conditioning (effective and quiet) and great sleep quality. The service is good. The view from the sea side rooms is great. The breakfast buffet is huge and offers plenty of choices for whatever you fancy.The downsides are the pool area and restaurants. The pool (salt water) is a bit small, but worse the capacity is just insufficient. In high season it's extremely difficult to find a place. And the food in the restaurants is just mediocre and expensive. You get your stomach filled, but it's not a meal that you would enjoy if you are a somewhat demanding diner. In other seaside locations both wouldn't be that big an issue. But here it is, as first there is no real beach that one staying at a Kempinski would like to go to. They have tied up with a '5-star' beach club on the seaside, but this is an extra EUR 20 per person per day, and hardly worth it. And second there are no restaurants in either Portoroz or Piran catering to the normal clientele of a rather up-market 5-star hotel like the Kempinski."
9.08.2012,5,"Without doubt the only true five-star hotel in Slovenia. Elegant, beautifully redecorated with spacious rooms, with all expected amenities, every detail taken care of. The enormous cost of rebuilding the not so long ago completely devastated Austro-Hungarian luxury hotel clearly shows in marble and decor. Reception quick, friendly and efficient, valet parking faultless. Sea view is a must, preferably in the »old«building, otherwise you might be slightly disappointed. To get to their seafront you need to cross a very busy road and pass cheap-looking shops that sadly the municipality refused to tear down for a more integrated hotel complex.I have tried the Sofia a-la-carte restaurant twice, was disappointed both times. German interpretation of Mediterranean cuisine is something I am unlikely ever to comprehend. Service at both occasions was well below expected standard, could be attibuted to the specific events that filled the hall completely and demanded top coordination. Breakfast is on self-service basis, to my regret, but the buffets are perfectly stocked and the cook on duty will prepare on demand a wide variety of dishes in front of you. Otherwise, breakfast service in the beautiful central restaurant hall is fine, bringing you a cappuccino or a glass of beer in no time.What greatly shocked me during my three visits there was wine pricing. Namely, Slovenia prides to be a wine country. I have only encountered similar markups on wine in top hotels and restaurants in Turkey (understandable for culture) and Russia (understandable for mindset). To sell a bottle of wine 200 yards from the nearest vineyard at >4 times the shop price is a bloody rip-off. Nobody in his sane mind (except for the shamelessly rich or Russians) will enjoy more than a few sips, especially so as the neighboring hotels and restaurants in Portorož have a far more normal approach. The hotel director simply has his views that can not be moved.BTW, they used to have a top French patisseur in their hotel patisserie, famous for arguably the best cakes in the country, but according to my info he left.Finally and shamefully, this is the first place in Slovenia where contrary to exisiting laws you are unlikely to survive speaking Slovenian. German or English is the official rule. Actually, it did happen to me once before, in the third best restaurant in Slovenia where Italian headwaiter did not understand a single word of this seemingly unpopular language. Still, all other staff did.You will pay quite dearly for your stay. But there again, it's a Kempinski and you expect that."
7.08.2012,5,"Kempinski palace is very nice. The room we stayed in was on the ocean side on floor 3 and had a small balcony. The view was amazing and the room itself was huge by European standards. Service was great and rooms were super clean The breakfast at the hotel was excellent, it had so many delicious choices. The hotel is quite expensive."
5.08.2012,4,Slovenia is one of the beautiful countries I visited. Hotel is located just at the sea side of Coratia and Slovenia. Rooms are renovated and very new. Spent 1 week there and enjoyed every moment. Bar at Lobby is great and staff as well. If you just walk outside you have loads of fast food and pizza joints. You can just walk around in the evening. Koper is also not so far. If you really walk you can otherwise taxi. I would recommend to all to visit this place and country once in lifetime.
23.07.2012,3,"This is my third time in Portoroz and my first time in the Kempinski palace hotel. The first impression is nice and clean. This impression ends as soon as you check in. One of the male receptionists, probably german origin, didn't greet us properly. He was sniffing and frustrated about his job. Right afterwards we went up to our room. We had a beautiful two bed superior room with sea view located in the old part. It was clean, thus much too cold interior. I don't recommend eating in the restaurants as the dishes are overpriced and the quality is a little above average. The waiters were unfriendly to and just waited until the guests went. The spa and the pool are great, the shops to. In total I recommend the hotel to those people who care about the hotel and not so about the staff. The hotel is nice but still I think there is a lot of improvement with the staff. PS: If you want to dine good for a little less then take the bus to Piran and stroll around the sea promenade. you'll find nice fish restaurants with local dishes."
22.07.2012,4,"Slovenia is beautiful and Portoroz and the areas that surround it are really exceptional. Looming over the main beach strip of Portoroz is the Kempinski Palace - with an old wing and a modern wing. It faces the beach and the older wing has this sensation of decadence, luxury and old wealth. I unfortunately got a room in the newer wing with its functional luxury appearance, glass and modern materials. The lifts are transparent here, so don't dig your nose while using it.My room faced the beach but unfortunately I couldn't access the balcony as I could not get the sliding door open - believe me, I tried. The room was spacious, fresh and nice. The bathroom was also a nice enough place and best of all it had a bidet. Despite the modernity, the room had a warmth to it, which I really appreciated. Since it was July, Portoroz was quite hot. So while my dinner was at the terrace of the old wing, it was humid. Food was brilliant and service was exceptional. The next day, the breakfast service too was very good. The food on offer was not that much in terms of choice, but it served the purpose. What I liked best was those little Austrian jam bottles which had pictures of paintings by Klimt and Egon Schiele - I would have collected those. Overall, this hotel is lavish and indulgent. I would have stayed longer if possible."
6.07.2012,5,"This was pre booked with business so I knew very little until arrival but this richly deserves its 5 stars and could mange another one!Check in was perfect and without drama, I needed 2 shirts ironing I had just bought and requested laundry service, they had an employee at my hotel room on the third floor before I even got there, what service, and the shirts immaculately ironed and returned within the hour.The room was immaculate as you would expect, everything you need and an instant fast Wi Fi connection. All the usuall bathroom treatments with a very powerful separate shower, as is traditional in Europe the bath towel was child size but there was enough of themThis hotel commands perfect views of the beach and sea, my balcony was very comfortable with a clear view but the hotels direct access to the beach and outside shops is its biggest charm , 1 minute and you there. TV channels were limited in English, I think the news was about it but I didn't go to watch TV as there is enough going on outside.Breakfast was a great occasion, plenty of choice and exceptional service. I couldnt fault the Kempinski and would definitely return, I didn't get to use the pool area but I imagined myself stretched out on a comfortable lounger, yes definitely return for pleasure ."
28.06.2012,5,"I have stayed at Palace Kempinski this spring and it is in my opinion a real five star hotel. It has everything: luxurious rooms, great spa and pool area, excellent service. The breakfast at the terrace is simply fantastic with lots of choices, from salmon to sparkling wine and you can enjoy it till 12.00. I like the design of the hotel and its location, right in the middle of Portoroz. Only the parking price (18 EUR per day) does not fit in this picture. A good choice for a high class vacation!"
26.06.2012,5,"Excellent hotel, just what you expect of Kempinski.It consists of two buildings, an old palace with old world charm and a modern one with exclusive design, somehow both look good together.The rooms are spacious and well equiped.The location is right in town, andas soon as you walk back to the hotel through the hotel gate, you leave the buzz outside.The sun bathing area is much nicer than the beach and therefore can get busy. The outdoor pool (33m length) is even good for lap swimming. All pools and whirlpools have salt water, which takes a bit of getting used to.The choice at breakfast is just great, you get all you expect for a continental or warm American breakfast.Hotel guests are some groups but mostly individual guests from all over Europe."
9.06.2012,5,"Having travelled all over the world and having stayed in probably a thousand hotels, this was one of the top experiences despite having spent only 1 night. Service is top, design is great, breakfast is super,...Amazing that such an hotel can survive in a ""lost"" place like Portoroz...Make sure you go for breakfast on the terrace with sea view..."
8.06.2012,5,"A wonderful hotel and what I would call a definite 5 star in everything. We just stayed for 1 night but enjoyed everything this hotel had to offer. The swimming pool well kept and lovely. The sauna spa etc lovely, a little smaller than I expected but very good, the gym extremely small. Drinks usual 5 star prices. We had an evening meal which was an experience wonderful food, wonderful service and a wonderful dining room.Our room was very well presented, beautifully decorated with everything you could possible need. We had a sea view with a huge balcony great views.The breakfast is another experience and one of the best we have had.We will definetly go back."
1.06.2012,5,"stayed for 2 nights and it was awesome. Woke up to a view of the sea and had breakfast at the terrace. The breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel. So much variety of the best quality cold cuts, cheese, fresh fruit and juices - antyhing you can think of having for breakfast, they probably have. Even shots of ginger juice - was great for my hungover tummy. The staff were really friendly, especially this German guy who managed the breakfast buffet, dude spoke like 8 languages.The room was amazing, the bed was comfortable (firm, but not hard), and there were speakers in the bathroom so you don't need to miss out on anything you're watching if you need to take a leak, HA!The pool area was also great, for people who would rather lounge there than on the beach, it's perfect."
25.05.2012,5,"I recently stayed at Kempinski hotel in Portorož as a part of a business trip for several days. The hotel is amazing, both from the furnishing, service and overall friendliness of the staff. Only kudos to all the people working at the hotel... Definitely worth visiting again! Hint: Breakfast, server on a sunny terrace is AMAZING!"
25.05.2012,5,"The hotel commands the waterfront of Portoroz, looking both elegant and tasteful unlike it's neighbors. There is an old wing that has been completely renovated and a very modern new wing. We had a waterfront room in the old wing with a very large and beautifully furnished room with very tasteful fixtures. The bathroom is also large and well appointed. The breakfast buffet is possibly the largest with the best variety and quality we have ever had. All the staff are polite but friendly and efficient. All in all a perfect hotel in an idyllic location."
24.05.2012,5,"One of the best hotels I've been to, great service, super clean rooms and bathrooms, excellent beds, top ! And the breakfast buffet is a must ! Don't miss it, it worth it !"
20.05.2012,5,"Typical 5* leasure hotel with very well trained staff. Excellent facility, great location. Good breakfast, but could have been improved with some more veggies."
9.05.2012,5,The best hotel in this region! Although the seaside is not as beautiful as in the south (meaning south Croatia :-) the service in this hotel is perfect! Do not miss the breakfast because it is a nice experience...
3.05.2012,5,"I have traveled a lot, and everytime I stay at a Kempinski Hotel, I am never disappointed. They have the best service, best locations, and they treat you the best."
6.04.2012,5,"It has been a perfect stay for us at this hotel - we both never experienced anything comparable (and we have been to an uncountable No of Grand- and 5 Star such as Emirates Palace, Burj Al Arab, Bensberg or Shangrila). Besides the modern and comfortable design and enteriour of the hotel it was especially your service team who made our stay unforgetable - starting from the reception / reservation who prepared a perfect room setting for our Honeymoon. Moreover your restaurant team was able to literally read every wish from our lips - we would like to especially thank the Restaurant Team who were unbelievably friendly and professional, creating a ""just like at my family"" atmosphere. And surely the Executive Chief Cook a real ""magican"", who created us individual dinner-arrangements which can only be described as ""perfect"". We never experienced such tasty food before!So all in all: we will highly recommend your hotel whereever it is possible and we are looking very forward for our next stay!"
30.01.2012,5,"I was there 3 times and I think that it is a matter of how the staff ""gets you"".If theye are in a good mood, you can get a marvelous room (once we were there 4 my BD in new part of the hotel, room was pirpple and amazingly beautiful plus clean) or you could get a 4**** room for the same price, same booking, same everything.It even depends on which part of the hotel they pick - new or the old one, diferent furniture, diferent ambient.The spa people are wonderful if they are there. I could never get to them through phone or reception. You have to be lucky.The breakfast is amazing though, if you are not a local (because they all speak ONLY enlish or italian - even though I am from Slovenia :)) Funny - they aro not thinking of the lokal turism?Terace is beautiful when sunny, pool area nice even in spring time, summers are amazing :)"
6.01.2012,5,"We have travelled to the Kempinski Palace for a weekend in September. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of Portoroz close to the public beach boulevard that has a wide variety of restaurants and cafe/bars. Parking which is the biggest issue in this small coastal resort is served by the hotel's own car park(note: despite the seemingly expensive price charged by the hotel the parking fee is actually in line with what you would be paying anyway but I suppose if you shell out 300EUR/night the parking fee will be last of your worries)Breakfast: simply put it immaculate and to the highest standards, definitely go out and have your breakfast on the terrace.Room: one of the best I have been to so far - spacious, soft colours and the most spacious bathroom ever!Spa area and swimingpool: modern and clean perhaps a little too short on sunbeds for the number of guests but nevertheless very stylish and classy.Overall do not hesitate to pay a little extra compared to other hotels in portoroz because it will be definitely worth it! hope to be back soon!"
6.01.2012,5,"This was my second stay at this wonderful hotel and it won't be my last. This time I stayed in the modern part of the hotel and the room was absolutely gorgeous. The sleep quality is superb. I cannot decide which rooms I like best - in the new part of the building or the old. All rooms are spacious, very clean, beautifully furnished and have a balcony. Just make sure you face the front side as the view is so much better. I stayed at the hotel in December (first time was in summer) and it was much quiter now. The breakfast choice was a bit more generous in high season and there was more foreign and better trained staff then. But our stay was still perfect and the hotel is an absolute architectural and design gem. I'm looking foreward to staying there in summer!"
8.12.2011,5,"Very beautifull and trendy hotel, one of the best sleeping choises in Slovenia. But small welness, no big view(roar and queu of kiosk like houses between the hotel and the sea).May be breakfast service to be improved."
18.11.2011,5,"what is there to say... a true dream experience an amazing room with wonderful amenities the swimming pool and the saunas accessible am with all the required amenitiesbreakfast in the crystal room was a true delight- the choice of freshly squeezed fruits, teas and bread choicesto be savored and recommended"
19.10.2011,3,"This old very well renovated palace is a unique hotel with a unique service. Staff is super friendly, the whole place is just WOW. Several bars, they project movies at night in the gardens around the hotel, own travel desk, super well maintained, etc....in oder words a real 5 star hotel.My only negative input is that the fitness is way too small for such a hotel, the deck chairs around the pool quite limited. So do like all Germans (yes I insist only Germans do that), before breakfast ¨reserve¨ a chair with your towel and than come to the pool whenever you want.....This unacceptable behaviour is tolerated from the hotel. So people sometimes arrive around twelve and block these seats.Anyway this amazing hotel is in my opinion overprized for its location. Portoroz is really nothing special. The fact that you have to pay expensive parking and quite expensive drinks is not really a necessity when you already pay 300 Euros for your room. This is not Monte Carlo, Porto fino or whatever fancy resort."
19.10.2011,5,"This hotel really stands out as a great place to stay. The staff are very well trained as you would expect from a top hotel but they offer a warmth to their guests that can't be faked. The rooms are comfortable and faultless and the food in the restaurants is excellent though a bit pricey, but you are in a 5* hotel, so it's to be expected and it was the best meal I have had in a long time! The resort of Portoroz is small but is beautifully maintained with clean beaches and lots of facilities. It was very quiet during October, but I am told it's buzzing in the high season. A walk along the sea front to the pretty nearby town of Piran is recommended where there are plenty of restaurants by the sea."
9.10.2011,5,"The hotel is really great. We have stayed there with my husband twice this year - once in the Spring and again for 4 days in the summer and I must say that we were very satisfied. The rooms are very spacious and clean and so is the entire hotel. The service was exellent as well. Breakfast was served in Crystal palace ball room which has a beautiful and large terasse where we enjoyed the great selection of croissants, fruits in perfect combination with a glass of champagne. The Apricot praline dessert I have tried in one of the restaurants was the best dessert I have ever tried.It was definetely a great expirience and we would really go back there again."
30.09.2011,4,"The hotel is in luxury class near the beach with 5 stars. Very good located in the center of Portoroz / Slowenia. The prices are rather high, altough i booked the hotel for low season from ebay actions. The hotel wasn't very full but from the check-in till check-out we felt that the hotel tries to get money for everything, especially from empyt outside parking :)) It has nice SPA and swimming pool, good hotel may be for elder people coz of it's silence but not a party hotel."
23.09.2011,5,"I stayed here during winter so I could not enjoy the pool area, but I have to say that it was a very very good experience. Firstly I got a double upgrade to a renovated room with amazing view. Bathroom was spacious and with very good courtesy line. Nice reception but no escorting service. Very nice buffet breakfast in the panoramic bar. Very good SPA service. Definitely my hotel should I come back to Portoroz."
22.09.2011,5,Excellent hotel (locally 5* superior) with very friendly and helpful staff. High level of service. Excellent breakfast buffet of international level. New building has very nice and comfortable rooms (front desk can adjust aircon temperature in room to your comfort level). Pool area can get crowded on weekends and in summer. Comment: discount offer by Tripadvisor has been discontinued by hotel but was still on Tripadvisor site.
20.09.2011,5,"I usually never evaluate a hotel while still staying there but now I'm safe to say this is my all time favorite hotel. Considering I travel about 4 days per week and usually stay in very nice hotels I really must say I was a bit surprised that they could just amaze me with all the kindness, level of service and level of comfort.What can I say?! It's a no-brainer where to stay when you are staying in Portoroz. Kempinski Palace."
18.09.2011,4,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel first time and I loved it. Staff is amazing, starting with reception, where young girls has been more then kind. Breakfest is magnificent, but food in Fleur de sal... Not that much. Fish was... Just not fish and the waiter was also quite rude. Poll is very nice, but a bit crowdy and we loved the room in the modern part-very nice. Room service was perfect, waiter Aljash (I hope that I write that correctly), was kind, polite and he even showed his skills by suggestig wine. My wife loved it. I have to say that also Stojan from Sofia was great and that all stuff is fantastic. Just improve food and housekeeping. Defenitly see you again.Joerg"
16.09.2011,5,"From the moment we telephoned the hotel from Australia to request information it was as a very welcome and warm reception. When we arrived at the hotel we were met by the Operations Manager, a German lady, who had studied Hospitality in Manly, Australia and was homesick for something Australian.This is a magnificent property where the old glamorous architecture have been beautifully restored and extended merging harmoniously. The hotel takes its theme from the name of the town ""Portoroz"", meaning port of roses. The 5 levels of the hotel are decorated in a different rose colour and the rooms are large and opulantly appointed.The staff are young, professional, friendly and very proactive, the word 'no' does not exist in their vocabulary. The grounds, where pool is, are expansive with views to the ocean as is the terrace where breakfast is served. Breakfast is a spectacular banquet where you have a choice of hot meals cooked to order and champagne.The easy walk to the historical town of Piran is delightful."
16.09.2011,5,"the service stood out here - nadja, a marketing officer, was particularly exceptional - while the food was also exquisite. local ingredients, great flavour combinations and attractive service made for appetising meal times. there's a good pool, which gets a little busy, as you'd expect. rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. a very good hotel."
12.09.2011,5,"The staff was very friendly and professional. Breakfast was superb and the facilities were impeccable. Beds were very comfortable,room was lovely and clean."
8.09.2011,5,"First when we came we were impressed by the size of the hotel, it is huge :)Then when we entered we remained without words...top design, clean, shiny and we felt like a billion euros as it is very glamorous. The best experience I had in the Spa as receptionist really showed the best interest for me to get the best treatment. After one massage I decided to get more treatments for my self and husband and we loved it! Try couples massage, therapists are very nice, gave us very good massages. There were candles, swans made from towels in the shape of heart, vine...amazing! Its worth of every single euro! We will be back, just husband and myself ;)"
6.09.2011,5,"Die Kombination zwischen Tradition und Moderne ist architektonisch sehr gut gelungen, Altbau und Neubau wurden wundervoll zusammengefügtDas Hotel ist perfekt ausgestattet. Sowohl die öffentlichen Bereiche als auch die Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll ausgestattet. Neben dem schönen Ambiente besticht vor allem das Service . Das Personal war sehr sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.  Das Kempinski Portoroz bietet Komfort in einer wunderschönen Umgebung und ist zu 100% empfehlenswert."
31.08.2011,4,"Nice hotel, helpful staff at the reception! So far so good! But I and my wife were kicked out from the restaurant because we did not want to eat we came to have a bottle of good wine and have chance to smoke outside (3 outside tables in the bar were reserved and we were instructed by the barman to go to the restaurant)! Even there were free tables in the restaurant we were not alowed to take one because our wish not to eat!!! So we were forced to go outside of this beautiful hotel and to spend our money somewhere else!!!"
22.08.2011,4,"Since this is a 5-star Kempinski property, everything else than perfect or almost perfect is not enough and should be noted. Therefore, I will try to summarize all the good but especially the bad in this review. The room: It was almost perfect, gigantic bed, bang and olufsen TV, huge bathroom with a massage tub, plenty of storage space. However, there was no minibar and therefore no glasses which we had to ask for, the housekeeping was a bit confused from time to time - turndown service was irregular, bathroom wasn't taken care of properly sometimes. We were probably upgraded as we got a sea view room, even though we didn't book one, which was great, but I think hotel should have informed us. Moreover, the room was apparently one part of a much bigger suite, which resulted in no minibar as mentioned before, a small study room, which was very nice but unnecessary as we would have definitely used a sofa and some armchairs instead, the bell in our room was connected to the bell in the other part of the suite so when someone rang the bell there, it also rang in our room and finally, the air conditioning was a bit slow sometimes and wasn't powerful enough for the big room.The Sun bed policy: We were very surprised to have not only towels but also our belongings taken away from our sun bed after coming back from a 45-minute lunch. We were told that the staff was supposed to make sun beds available after 30 minutes if nobody occupied them. That would make sense, of course. However, there is also a no-reservation policy and when we arrived at the pool area at about 10 45, almost all loungers were taken, nobody was using them and nobody did anything about it for 2 or more hours... That was a bit unexpected in such a luxurious hotel. Other than that, everything else was great. Staff was attentive and nice, the hotel is very well maintained and elegant and the breakfast was to die for. The pool area was a bit crowded but we didn't mind that much. The indoor/outdoor salt water pool was big enough, the water temperature was pleasant. I would definitely appreciate some more sunshades, though - sometimes it was pretty hard to find a sun bed with a sunshade. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't have a private beach, you can use other public/private beaches for a fee, but sea access wasn't very good - there were either pebbles or sea weed near the entrance to the sea. We didn't get to try the restaurants because they were overpriced and there were many other options around. I would recommend restaurants in the nearby town of Piran, which is beautiful and the restaurants are very good and affordable. To sum it up, despite the minor flaws, the hotel is great and we had a wonderful holiday. We would surely come back."
7.08.2011,5,"There is not a lot to dislike in this hotel. It is almost perfect. Clean rooms, awsome breakfast buffet with several warm dishes on order, formal but friendly service and a large indoor and outdoor swimmingpool. Parking has to be paied at 18 Eur/day! The only thing I really missed in this hotel was a hook in the bathroom to hang up the bathrobe."
2.08.2011,5,Fantastic swimming pool and spa area. Rarely had difficulty finding a sun lounger but some hotel guests reinforced teutonic stereotypes by placing towels on loungers at sunrise.Stayed in the new wing of hotel and the room easily accomodated my wife and I and young son. Breakfast was available until midday on a lovely terrace next to the garden area and the food selection was extensive and of high quality. Staff excellent with one exception - a female member of the reception staff who was surly. Would definitely return!
29.07.2011,5,"The hotel is good, but only if you are not too picky. It's new, so it is actually very beautiful and without signs of wear and so on. But the staff is so so and the waiters probably don't have a suit to change if they get dirty in the line of work. They can bring you a rare wine bottle for 5000 EUR, but you don't order it because you don't want to have it served by a waiter that does not look to be very professional and has big stains on his suit. Many staff are not Slovenian but imported from ex-Yugoslavia, so they can get lower salaries. That does not give a service standard that one wealthy guest would expect from a pricy 5 star hotel. Otherwise, everything else was very nice and the food good too, so I guess, no REAL complaints after all. Just be sure to take maybe a discount package or something like that, because the hotel is good but not as good as its regular prices are. So, we'll come back, as this is actually the only real 5 star hotel in Portoroz and one of the best in Slovenia after all."
29.07.2011,5,"I found the hotel excellent, very nice room, building, swimming pool and outstanding breakfast. Did not use the restaurant facilities though. The Slovenian coast itself is a very nice mixture of Italian and Balkan (former Yugoslavian) atmosphere. In one word: perfect holidays. 5 stars rating is an exceptional rating, but they deserve it. Small minus point: when entering or leaving the hotel (and asking them to pick up the car for example), the reception and front desk boys are a bit ""staring"" at the guests and having their own comments amongst hemselves apparently. :-)"
26.07.2011,5,"This is a magical hotel with beautiful rooms and great views to the Adriatic sea. Service and food were top drawer .The property is simply magnificent. The room we booked has been huge with all amenities excellent, WiFi internet connection- free of charge. Buffet breakfast has been fabulous and served till 12 a.m. :) The place served at is just amazing- if not mistaken called 'Crystal Hall'. I truly recommend that hotel spoiled by our memorable experience within Kempinski Palace Portoroz. ???? ? ????????? ????? ? ??????? ???? ? ????????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ????.???????????? ? ??????? ?? ???-?????? ????. ??????? ? ?????? ???????????. ????????????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ????????? ? ??????, WiFi ???????? ?????? ???? ?????????. ????????? ?? ??????? ???? ? ????????? ? ?? ??????? ?? 12 ?.:) ? ? ?????? ??????????, ??? ?? ?????, ????????

16.07.2011,3,"We've chosen the Kempinski Hotel in Portoroz based on our (outstanding) experience with another hotel from the same group (the Duke's Palace in Bruges). But after our 4 days' stay, we have to conclude that it's not upto the same 5 star level, alas.There are 2 restaurants, so they say. But that's not the case: the one restaurant (Fleur de Sel) gets its dishes from the kitchen of the other one (Sophia), located at the complete opposite side of the two buildings wide hotel. Perhaps that's the cause of the long waits between dishes: one hour between first and main plate was not an exception, unfortunately. For the complete 3 dishes half-board menu you'd easily need 3 hours, and that's not acceptable in a 5-stars hotel. On top of that we find prices for wine starting at something like 35 and easily going over 100 EUR a bottle largely exagerated in a southern, wine producing country as Slovenia.The swimming pool is a connecting indoor and outdoor one, but unfortunately has salted water in it. The room service gradually ""forgets"" about you: the first day beds were done properly and early, and we got enough towels, shampoo & shower gel for 3 persons, but the last 2 days we had to phone the roomkeeper in the afternoon to get someone for servicing, and all of a sudden we had to manage with only two sets of fresh towels. Other details like this (although important, given the applied prices) led us to conclude that this Kempinski is not really up to its advertized 5 stars, but instead is more of an average 4 star hotel.Apart from that, think twice about travelling to the Slovenian coast. Portoroz and Piran disappointed us: practically no shops nor any cozy streets to stroll through, none (Portoroz) or only a rudimentary (Piran) coast promenade, a casino on every street corner,... To summarize: everything breathes more of an former East-European atmosphere in a region where firm Western prices are applied for drinks, restaurants & shops (if any). The slogan applied must be ""Come visit us, we need (and we'll get) your money""..."
24.06.2011,5,"I visited the Kempinski Portoroz as a member of a large corporate group in June. I expected an efficient conference hotel - and indeed it was - but it also is exactly what a 5 star hotel should be all about. First of all it is an imposing, big, classy oldi building that sits on the seafront, separated by a road and a parade of shops and restaurants. the hotel has been resored with great care. The bedrooms are big, roomy modern affairs, with great beds and bathrooms. The common parts are cool - particulary the uber-trendy white bar. The grounds are 'Slovenian zen' and the pool is nice (salt water) but perhaps too small for a hotel of this size , and surrounded by sad rows of loungers. The spa is teriffic. However the best part of the hotel is the staff ,who are simply amazing - they have eyes in the back of thier heads and are superbly accomodating and attentive. If there is a drawback, I'd say it's the town of Portoroz itself...just a bit crummy and cheap. But up the road you have Piran, which is the total reverse - fantastic!"
13.06.2011,5,"I've been to Portoroz and have enjoyed good times, good food and good service in many places there, but having just stayed at the Kempinski, I must say that I'm now spoiled for any other location.Their rooms are nice with lovely views of the Adriatic. You can sit outside and enjoy breakfast as you watch the town slowly come to life. The restaurants are good but hard to get into -- reserve your table as soon as you check in! -- but if they're not to your taste, Portoroz and nearby Piran offer so many great places to eat that you should be sure that you've got an unused notch on your belt.The crowning item, however, was the service. One of the front office managers, Natasha Karat, made me feel as though she were there just to look after me and whatever I needed. I so very much look forward to my next trip to Slovenia's beautiful coast."
29.05.2011,5,"I think this hotel easily comes into top 5 best European hotels. It's absolutely flawless. Great staff, everything works as it should, very stylish interior and exterior, exellent food and also for the time of our stay - exellent weather. If you go there, you should take care not to overload your stomach during breakfast (which is until 12o'clock btw), because every dish is so delicious!! Super nice fitness, WIFI, pool (in&out), spa, sauna, the best beds in the world and much more included in the price. If not the best it is certainly the best bang for the buck. We also had a dog and he too was treated like a king..."
18.05.2011,5,"the hotel is absolutly beautiful! it has a wunderful pleasant and modern ambiance. one part of the hotel is very old (from the time of austria royal dynasty) and the other part is new - and it fits perfect together. the whole hotel is nice decorated. our room was lovely, with very cosy beds, nice bath and view to the sea.the staff is very professionel and friendly. the garden and the pool and spa-area are also beautiful, with good services.the price of the room was low, because it was low-season, otherwise it`s high.we only ate at the pool-area. it was ok, nothing special, but high price. the breakfast was included and very good, with lots of choices, also fine for the eyes. it was served in the old part of the hotel - the cristal-room. impressiv! this hotel is perfect for this area, for a short stop, to relax and visit Piran."
10.04.2011,3,"We went to Portoroz for a conference. The hotel is a nicely restored former jewel of the Adriatic, staff is exceptional and kind. Rooms are not the biggest, bathrooms rather small. Breakfast was nice, but not exceptional. Our bathroom badly needed maintenance: personal scale was out of order, batteries old and corroded. Taps on the sink not properly fitted, cold water running very slowly. Traces of mold around bathtub. The biggest negative surprise was additional charge to my credit card several days after the check-out, without any notice or invoice sent. So be aware."
27.03.2011,5,"The location is beautiful. The hotel is amazing. The service is fantastic. The half-board was GREAT; it includes both breakfast and a 3-course dinner. The only thing not to love is the price... but that's to be expected. If budget and locations allow, I will go out of my way to stay at Kempinski every single time in the future. What a place!"
2.12.2010,5,"We went to Portoroz for a conference and before coming everybody expected some kind of a village. Trieste airport didn't surprise us, but when we passed the highway and got into the town I was shocked - this is one of the most beautiful places in Europe. Nature is stunning, evergreen. In November town is quiet but I guess in summer it's bubbling as any other resort. The hotel consists of two parts - Palace and modern (kind of high-tech)- located just two steps from the beach. Room was spacious and very light, nice little terrace where you have a cigarette and watch the sunset. Ah, and you have wi-fi for free evrywhere at the hotel."
1.12.2010,5,"I have never been in Slovenia and honestly never though about going there. After my stay there, I am seriously considering this as a future holiday destinations.I stayed at the Kempinski for a conference and was amazed by the quality this hotel offers. Here are a few highlights:- Every service staff addressed me by name and was not just polite (likein other hotels, but warm and welcoming!)- My room had sea view (so no problem waking up with such a great view). Bathroom was huge, with separate bath and shower and plenty of amenities- Housekeeping made sure the room is always tidy.- Room Service is just wow.: Try the Beef with black Truffels!- Conference Facilities were great and service was discrete- The Slovenian national team stayed there when I was there.There is a casino right next to the hotel, but I did not manage to go."
25.11.2010,5,I have recently been in Portoroz due to a conference. I can recommend this hotel with outstanding service.The rooms are very spacious and I had a great room facing the sea.The meeting was exceptionally well organized and the staff was very friendly.I even had the time to enjoy the great SPA facilites.I really recommend this hotel!
25.11.2010,5,The stay was amazing. The check in was smooth. Rooms are spacious and cozy. Nice welcome ameneties and free high speed internetThe staff has an amazing smile and were very helpful and professional
24.11.2010,5,"I visited the hotel in the course of a conference. Arriving in the hotel after a drive of one hour and 15 minutes through the landscape of Slovenia the staff was very warm welcoming. A lot of press was around and we felt very honored until we realized, they were not there because of us but waiting for the arrival of the national Slovenian football team:-) still nice...throughout our stay the staff of the hotel took of us with the utmost attention and care. The room was very spacious with a contemporary and luxury interior and a fabulous sea view. The conference area is located in the newer part of the hotel having a medium sized conference room and some breakout room with modern equipment. Reataurant and Bars have very goos and attentive service staff. I highly recommend the spa Area of the hotel which is a fantastic alternation to relief from the stress of the conference. All in all a great hotel, highly to recommend"
11.10.2010,5,"This is an absolutely fantastic hotel, one which I would highly recommend, and I am very tempted to go back very soon. It is a very relaxing environment where nothing is too much trouble for the staff. In all honesty there wasn't much need for the staff as everything was perfect in the first place.The pool and spa area is a real indulgence of luxury, especially after walking to Piran and back, and it was a novelty to have an indoor/outdoor salt water pool - very enjoyable.The rooms are spacious and very comfortable and the bed is divine. You can even purchase the pillows from the front desk should you get too attached and want one for your own home.The hotel is well situated and you can easily amble to Piran along the coastline. We stayed here for 3 nights, all of which were exceptional."
3.10.2010,5,"The hotel itself is beautiful, the atmosphere even more so. When we arrived, we could check in early (even though it was high season) and they automatically upgraded us to a room with a better view. The room was spacious and elegantly furnished, the view was fantastic - all of the promenade and sea (we were staying at a higher floor). There's an extensive room service. Breakfast was very anjoyable (high variety food, dining alfresco on a terrace) - staff very polite and welcoming. The pool was also nice, comfortable sun lounges, although it can get crowdy in the middle of the season, very good pool menu (the best chicken salad I ever had). The garden surounding the hotel could not be more gorgeous. I would and definetely will stay there again."
22.09.2010,5,"If you are looking for a place to relax, the Kempinski in Portoroz is the place. It has just been totally redone and it is absolutely gorgeous! It has the best service, a reasonably price spa with great treatments and really good beds. The rooms were very quiet and very large. It is just across the street from the seaside with all of its restaurants and beaches. And, about 1.8 km from Pirin. The staff went out of their way on everything from parking our car to room service. I can't say enough good things about them."
28.08.2010,5,"Amazing service, friendly staff, beautiful room, Spa a bit small but still great, just the best breakfast ever...those who disliked this hotel really have hight expectations. Room service late at night with no problem, overall really an amazing experience. The location itself is ok, definitely the best hotel on Slovenian coast."
26.08.2010,3,"First of all, the Hotel itself is beautiful! Actually one of the nicest settings I have ever been to.However there is a lack of professionality regarding how the Hotel is managed.The Management (at least the people who we saw, like the General Manager and the F&B Manager) are quite young. I actually don't mind that, but I find it quite disturbing when these people have a problem greeting their guests when they meet them within the hotel (several times). However, you can see, that there are still a lot of problems. The staff is not very well trained. We saw that a lot during breakfast. The staff at the pool is more busy watching their PC screen than looking out for their guests. This leads to a problem when you get down to the pool after 11 am, as you might have problems finding an empty sun bed. We wrote a long letter to the GM as we always believe that you can only learn if you know. So far there was no response, let's see if we get one.It is hard for me to say if I would recommend this Hotel to a friend. It is, as I said, a beautiful hotel, but so far the service is not up to the 5 Star Standard."
23.08.2010,5,"Excellent new hotel. Competent management, well-trained staff, even concierge knows what he is doing. Free unlimited internet in rooms! Not much of a view from the room though and the balcony too small to comfortably sit there (we were in the new part of the hotel). Otherwise the rooms are fantastic, new, shiny, sparkling clean. I think it's the best hotel in the area."
20.08.2010,4,"nice location, near the sea but without direct view to beach ( some buildings with shops !!!), nice renovated rooms, SPA should be bigger, outdoor pool ok, very nice breakfast, could eat outside, in gourment restaurant ""Sophia"" problems with service ( wait to long) and I expect much better food ( via Michelin way) but in other, second hotel restaurant ""Fleur de sel"" profesional waiters team but food also notning realy special. In both restaurants to expensive Slovene wine even for 5 star hotel"
2.08.2010,5,"The Hotel Kempinski Palace Portoroz is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. The staff are exceptionally friendly. When they found out it was our honeymoon they kept the champagne coming. They also made a cute little design on our bed. Although the hotel does not have it’s own beach, it rents a part of the best private beach for which you have to pay 20euro a day per person. We found this to be a very acceptable solution for the time being. They are nice enough to give you some fruit and water for the beach. There is also a very nice inside/outside pool area and a sauna area, both of which we enjoyed tremendously as they are very clean, calm and have a sense of peace about them. The breakfast is also spectacular by any standard. (you can literally get whatever you want...except for caviar) They organize film nights outside when the weather permits; also a very enjoyable evening event. Now for the tiny ‘flaw’. The food, although of a high quality, lack imagination and is as a result overpriced. The menu also lacks inspiration. (It fails to utilize local sea-food, truffles...ect.)"
16.07.2010,4,"Beginning July I spent 2 days for a business meeting. The rooms are spacious, and very relaxing. Staff is friendly, but somehow I have the feeling that the staff is not at usual Kempinski level. Soem of my colleagues arrives before midnight and had to look half an hour to find someone for checking in. Excellent Spa treatments, and very nice swimming pool. The quality of the food is excellent, but maybe 2 comments on this: the ? la carte restaurants are a bit overpriced, and for this level of Hotel I do not like that at breakfast you have to pick your marmelade with a spoon out of the pot. (maybe I am spoiled, but at this level i expect nice tiny little marmelade glasses) About Portoroz, what should I say, I know the place very well, and it is not something to compare with Saint-Tropez in France. Nice shops are absent, just the usual tourist shops, so somehow the level of this hotel does not fit in the environment. Will definitely try the other Kempinski in Savudrija, just 30 minutes away from this one."
3.07.2010,5,"Hotel Kempinsky Palace is a beautifully restored ‘Grand Hotel’ at the boulevard of Portoroz. I would call it a design hotel that has opened its doors only last year after an extensive renovation. The hotel overlooks the sea, but there is a rather busy road in between. The crystal room is planned for breakfast and it has a fantastic terrace to enjoy the breakfast buffet, that has an overwhelming choice of food and freshly baked eggs. The lunch was also very good.The room was large, with a design bath room and all toiletteries you expect in a 5-star hotel. I had a large balcony. Free wireless internet. Worthwhile to mention: excellent sleeping quality of the bed. There is a parking garage below the hotel, which I never saw as the door man parked my car, which was very convenient of course.All staff was extremely friendly and helpful, with attention to small details. Really a great service. I enjoyed my stay from the beginning to the very last moment."
1.07.2010,5,"This is probably the best hotel in whole Slovenia. Exellent service and everything what you demand from 5 star hotel. Beach is on the other side of the road. It is a bit overcrowded but hotel has a private part with sunbeds und umbrellas. If you prefer you can stay at quiet and nice hotel indoor and outdoor pool. Good SPA superb breakfast. plenty of restaurants with good seafood in the neibourhood. Close to major Slovenian attractions - caves, Piran, Bled, Lipica, Ljubljana, Koper. Consider one day excursion to venice if you have time!"
1.06.2010,5,"Travellers -this is a fantastic hotel with lots of interesting design elements - i waas personally really surprised to find stuff in decor and rooms that vi had not seen before. The Hotel is placed in Portoroz, which is good for a few days but certtainly offers many cheaper alternatives to stay. However, a super'nice country like Slovenia really deserves a Hotel at its short coast like this Kempinski quality place.Of special note is - Restaurant Flor de Sal- The Spa place, with an outdoor swimmingpool- the small but stylish Gym withz brandnew equipment hardly ever used- the Cristal room for the breakfasti can recommend a sty for a few days, and make sure you go by PIRAN for dinner one night."
23.03.2010,5,"This hotel is beautiful, excellent, spotless and the service is faultless. Attention is paid to every detail both in the superb rooms and the public areas. The spa is a joy and the food in the restaurant was superb"
18.02.2010,3,"We stayed in the hotel in spring 2009 with our daughter. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms comfortable and there is nothing bad we can say about the location and the food. Never the less we have had a chance to see cocroaches in the childrens playroom near the main lobby and after mentioning it to the staff at the reception we received an answer that somebody forgot to close the door leading to a storage or something. The second negative comment is that the hotel has by far to small gym for its category and it is located in the top floor very poorly marked (at least at the time of our stay). By the way, despite the fact that I smoke, the manager of the hotel left a negative impression by smoking in the bar alongside the restaurant. Bravo, it does seam that laws are not made for everybody."
5.01.2010,5,"One of the best hotels i`ve ever been to. Beautiful historical building that reminds past centuries, amazing environment, great staff...rooms were, as i`d expected, stylish like in other hotels of this cathegory (grey`n`light brown tones) with a huge bathroom and all the necessary accessories (slippers included;-). Even though we didn`t have a room with sea view (it overlooked the garden), i was pretty surprised with lavender pillows and the atmosphere in general. The only thing i remembered as negative was the overpampering of the guests:-). Staff kept knocking on the door asking if everithing was ok or if we need something etc. The stricker ""do not disturb"" would do the trick;-)Check out the breakfast. (the best choice ever!!! try the granola cookies and youghurts.)They even had the healing teas and cranberry juice which came in handy by the time i was there. This hotel is a TOP!"
2.01.2010,5,"From the moment we checked in, until we left four days later nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We enjoyed the Spa so much we visted twice. The meals and wine selection were well priced and very good value.Our next visit to Portoroz would not feel complete if stayed in any other Hotel."
29.12.2009,3,"A Kempinski hotel in Slovenia - a new hotel in a country we had not visited before. I ignored a review I had read about Portoroz prior to booking - it had said that every country had a Blackpool or a Las Vegas and Portoroz was the Las Vegas of Slovenia - in a way the review was correct. The Kempinski hotel looks magnificent sitting there in its well manicured gardens. However it is surrounded by hotels and buildings that are neither elegant, well cared for or even remotely attractive. Directly across the road from the Kempinski are shops (not worth a look), casinos and bars which play very loud music until 4.00 am every morning. So loud infact that having your windows open was impossible. We had driven from the UK. In a 5 star hotel one expects a porter to immediately spring into action as soon as you drive up. Not so here. Not impressive. Check-in staff good.We had a suite facing the sea in the old palace building. I say facing the sea as a seaview would be an incorrect description. The sea can be glimpsed to left and right but the buildings across the road obscure much of the seaview. The suite was lovely. The bedroom was rather cosy, but the big bed was comfortable. The 'pillow menu' was a plus although when we requested feather pillows they took an age to arrive. The sitting room was huge with a dining area at one end. Flat screen TVs in bedroom and sitting room. However, when we wanted to listen to music via the tv we would have been charged a hefty fee - not on!Good bathroom with lots of good quality products to use. However, the temperature on the shower would vary for no reason and we escaped scalding on several occasions. We reported this and were told they knew about it but there was nothing they could do.Housekeeping was dreadful. Every day something was wrong. Some days they simply forgot to service the room. Towels and products were not replaced. Empty wine bottles and trays of coffee not removed even when the room had been serviced. On the first day we requested extra large dressing gowns - they arrived just before we went out for dinner - when we returned they had vanished with the 'turndown staff' we assumed. It took another day for others to arrive - not good. Some days the bed was turned down - others not - ditto fresh towels being supplied after pre dinner shower. Housekeeping staff were too few, badly trained and badly managed.Never ask room service for a tray of coffee. Always took more than half an hour - coffee was always cold - one day they forgot the milk the next they forgot the biscuits - we gave up.The buffet breakfast was good, heaps of choice, hot, cold, everything you could possibly want. The fruit and fresh ginger shots were a real wake-up!! However some days the service was dreadful. No-one seemed to be in charge and no-one was specifically charged to show you to a cleared table and ensure there was cutlery and staff to attend the table. Some days you could wait ages for coffee. Too few staff and those that were there were often badly trained and had no idea how to serve at table. Staff with attitude first thing in the morning is a definite NO.We feel the hotel needs to rethink its dining facilities. The Sophia Restaurant - very formal - too formal really for a hotel in a resort like Portoroz. We went once. The food was good but the service unacceptably slow. No-one on hand to give good advice on wines - we know a great deal abount Italian and French wines but not Slovenian - if they want to sell some they should be able to advise accordingly. The room itself is rather gloomy and depressing. The hotel needs to rethink how it communicates a dress code to guests. Shorts and tee shirts are not really acceptable for dinner in a formal restaurant! The other dining option is the Fleur de Sel. Far less formal with some outside seating.However the menu needs to change far more frequently. No difference in Lunch and Dinner menu. If the hotel wants people to eat in its restaurants it needs to have a drastic rethink. Having dinner there one night, we ordered a bottle of Italian wine - it took over half an hour to appear and was very cold. We were then told all wine was 'kept at the other end of the building' - hence the long wait. We would regularly meet other guests in restaurants in Portoroz and Piran who felt the hotel was missing a trick. Most of the restaurants in Portoroz and Piran have very similar menus, my husband thinks there is one communal kitchen!!!The so-called pool-side bar was a joke. Some days what appeared to be students sometimes appeared to see if guests required drinks or a snack. Service was very slow and unprofessional. The snacks menu lacked everything, content, imagination etc. You are relaxing by the wonderful pool on a sunny day. You do not want to have to move, get dressed to go outside the hotel for a snack...........come on Kempinski get your act together. There was one table with chairs by the pool. The others were low coffee tables with chairs, no shade, no umbellas.The pool area, inside and out is lovely. Big terrace, lots of comfy sun beds etc. Great facilities also in that area, turkish and steam rooms and ample supplies of good quality towels.The Spa too was extremely good and the staff excellent. Good choice of treatments - I had a hot stones massage and facial which were amazing. Beware the manicure and hairdressers room. I did not know that this was not actually part of the Spa - nowhere was this made clear although it is of course in the hotel. When I came to the end of the worst manicure I have ever experienced, (my nails have not recovered yet), I asked for the slip to sign for it to be included on our room bill as you would expect. It was only then that I was told they were not part of the hotel spa and could I pay now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A problem occured on our departure. We left our bags in the middle of the hallway in our suite - all in one place. We asked a porter to collect them and take them to our car. As we had driven from the uk we had several bags and were travelliing onward to Tuscany. We went to pay the bill and then drove off. When we arrived in Tuscany later that day we were one bag short. I telephoned the hotel, told them where the bags had been left, they sent someone up to our room and sure enough - the bag was still sitting there. They sent a driver with the bag to our destination in Tuscany and it arrived before midnight the same day!Lovely building, hopeless housekeeping and sloppy service in many areas. Its no excuse for a 5 star hotel to not be firing on all cylinders from the moment it opens its doors to guests. Excuses are not acceptable. If local staff cannot maintain a standard of service required for that level of hotel after professional training - its a serious management problem."
29.09.2009,3,"We stayed in August one week with our two little children. As mentioned the hotel is very nicely renovated, has lovely rooms, a great terasse to enjoy the wonderful breakfast buffet, a nice garden, many motivated and friendly employees and great food at room-service. Still, during our trip not everything was perfect: Four times electricity went down in our room, at the ckeck-in desk the employees had to answer the phone at the same time as making the check-in, luggage arrived an hour after ckeck-in, room service for cleaning sometimes came, sometimes not, once at 10 pm (not helpful with little children) and forgot half the things to do... As we wanted to go a day on the beach, we had to pay an extra 40€ per adult, just be be on a stone wall strech between many other people, in the same squeeze as at the pool (which is nice..). At night, no one wanted to turn down the volume of the outdoor movies. I phoned many times, at the end no one answered at concierge or reception desk....After I complained, we received a bottle of sparkling wine and later from the GM a invitation to come back, so mangement acted quickly and in a professional way. I have to say that other guests we talked to did not encounter the same problems we had. For us and with this prices, unfortunately Kempinski standards where not met this time and I guess that more training is needed to give the employees more self-confidence and natural joy for their work. We went a day to the Kempinski in Istrien which has a big and lovely pool area for children. Potoroz is quite crowded in August, but not the loveliest sea side village yet (I have been reading a comparison to the Cote d'Azur - this is really exaggerated!), which is a bit of a contrast to the lovely Kempinski Portoroz. The sea was also nicer on the Istrien than Slovenien side."
13.09.2009,4,"We spent one night only for my conference reason, but my wife tried it as a holidaymaker. Problem started allready when I tried to reach the reservation service by telephone - the line was constantly broken. We made it via mail, but anyway at the end they wrote my company name wrong on the bill...ehhh.The building is indeed renovated on the site of the historical Palace hotel. So you can see a mixture of styles - some of them like that, some of them not. The direction signs from the main avenue are definitelly to small (note for small blue plates). Place is indeed shiny allover and our room was big enough with a big balcony and two sun beds(superior room, sea wiew). The technical equipment of room was good and the decoration tastly chosen. For 250 EUR/night we got a single bottle of still water in room as a reception gift - allright, lets say fair enough. When we arrived, nobody gave a helping hand with luggage, the boy actually stared away through the window. The check-in procedure was pretty fast, basic informations on the reception were adequate. At the evening they helped us with the ""emergency"" toothbrush set, but needed ca. 30 minutes to deliver it. At the breakfast we waited much too long to be asked and served with a coffee. Girls (obviously international staff in training) seemed confused and actually did not speak really good any language. When wrong person sitted at the reserved table (it was just near mine), they used a sentence ""this for somebody else, please go"" !!!!! Definitelly much to low attitude for a 5 star Kempinski. Otherwise the food selection is rich and breakfast takes untill midday. The indoor swimming pool was nice and clean and they have finnish, turkish and infrared sauna. You can also get a turkish massage (Hammam). The pool and saunas were totally empty on saturday morning, which was nice. At the end the check-out was slow and they obviously had not connection with booking service, I needed to tell them again all billing information (other guests waiting behind me in a row - like in a supermarket). Reception staff payed more attention to chit-chat among them than to a guest sitting in front. Finally again nobody offered a help with luggage transfer to car. I might did not look as a local mafia boss to be treated reasonably. And yes, they forget to charge garage fee (18 EUR). I was bad and did not remind them ;-). Klemen & Vesna Grabljevec, Ljubljana, Slovenia"
7.09.2009,5,"Worthwide going to discover Slovenia now there is a Kempinski Hotel in Portoroz. The staff made our stay enjoyable and unforgettable. They were devoted and passioned and nothing was too much asked. For a long weekend stay or a summer break, worthwide to discover this beautiful perfect located hotel."
2.09.2009,4,"Very nice and comfortable hotel. Friendly staff, great location, good value. The diner at Sofhia restaurant was really great and delicious, our compliments to chef Sascha Lenz."
28.07.2009,3,"Yes, this hotel is the best you can get in this town. But unfortunately we were not so satisfied with this hotel. Paid more than 1k/night for suite, we didn´t get what we paid for: 1. balcony of Lagune suite is not a private balcony, is connected with other suites and also with the public fitness center (you cannot feel privacy while enjoying the jacuzzi) 2. fruit in our room after arrival was mouldy and we didn´t get another fruit troughout our stay, 3. housekeeping service was not appropriate and not on time, 4. Lagune suite and public fitness is connected only with the door, so we were not able to sleep, when someone started to uplift the dumbells early in the morning5. terrace wasn´t cleaned throughout our whole stay in the hotel, it was full of bird feathers and bird excrements,6. final bill was 10% higher when compared with the real comsumption, more than 250 € is a realy big mistake, than corrected without any apology... and many other problems, but the building is realy beautiful. What I liked is the possibility to take a dog with you - there were many dogs in the hotel."
28.03.2015,5,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel in superior room with balcony in old part of hotel. Room was space, nice, very clean, with no dust. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was clean, nice, with marble.WiFi was free.Stuff was very friendly, professional, and helpful. It seems they enjoy their work. Check in and out were quick and without any problems. I have only breakfast. It was great- a lot of choice, delicious food. Cook made fresh waffles and pancakes. There was also food for people who have diabetes. They also have their one wine cellar. There was nothing to complain. I think it deserve 5*."
25.03.2015,5,"Amazing hotel! Very clean, modern, excellent service, spa and pool! Rooms are super big, with a big and clean bathroom! Wifi connection works very well! Just the breakfast could be a bit better...moreover I've found a fantastic offer and I've paid for 1 night just 70 €!!!!"
14.03.2015,5,"Rooms are great, very well equiped, confortable bed, service is very good, food is very good. I had also an amazing view from balcony. I had a pleasant stay there aldought it was December and not much to do"
6.02.2015,5,"We had a short stay at Kempinski palace Portorož and it was excelent! Delux room was great, breakfast to die for and spa experience was fabulous! Reception staff is kind and welcoming, valet service efficient. The best hotel in Slovenia! We will be back!"
4.02.2015,5,"Beautiful hotel, great relaxing atmosphere in the piano bar. Breakfast was amazing and the prosecco added to that luxury feeling. The room was clean and comfortable. We had one night in this hotel but we could have stayed longer. Value for money!"
2.01.2015,3,"The hotel had nice rooms. We had a sea view room. There was noise (music) from the nearby cafe or a discotheque until quite late. No response from the hotel when we complained about it.The pool has sea water, which is nice. The saunas are not bad as well.The breakfast was ok.The service was hit and miss, even though it was clear that people were trying. No desire to return albeit for visiting nearby Trieste, Croatia and Slovenia are probably better options esp. off-peak season. Expensive parking."
26.12.2014,5,"Stayed with my wife and two young children in September on a 10 week tour of Europe. Modern hotel with very good facilities. Rooms were spacious and modern. I would probably call it a business hotel as it has large conference facilities, etc., which could mean it might get rather crowded, but when we were there it was fully booked and it did not feel crowded. Good spa with nice indoor and outdoor pool. Good location in the middle of Portoroz and just a 5 minute drive from beautiful Piran. We stayed here instead of Piran because we wanted the full set of amenities. We felt it was good value for a business 5 star hotel. The one negative was the large breakfast room which was a rather manic and crowded."
3.12.2014,5,"We stayed in Portoroz in October with family. The hotel has a modern and a classical part, we stayed in the modern part, 3rd floor, partial seaview, big balcony. Well, this is a 5 star Kempinski, so we were absolutely satisfied with the room and everything. Didn't try the outside pool, because it was cold or closed at this time of the year. Pool area and spa is nothing special for me. Breakfast in the ballroom is very nice, looking at the garden area, a big plus for the breakfast till noon. Parking fee is a little expensive. Staff was helpful. The location is fantastic, Portoroz & Piran are beautiful, I loved the seaside, even though we were out of season, so didn't swim in the sea."
26.11.2014,5,"We will return to this magnificent palace with an amazing SPA ...we loved breakfast until 12 in the amazing Crystall Hall as well as our deluxe room on the top floor with delightful sea view.Very affordable Kempinski to return to, friendly and professional staff"
25.11.2014,5,"nothing else to say just perfect. reception and concierge amazing, restaurant and bar very good, room and the hotel in general 5*. The concierge organized us a hunting within 15 min drive from the hotel an dit was realy great!"
2.03.2015,5,"This time we just went there to have a coffe on the terrace of this hotel. This is the most beautifull terrace at the Slovenian cost. With a fantastic view. You can just seat there in peace and enjoy the view.Service is also great, very nice and kind waitress, good coffee.I really like coming back every time I can. And I cannot wait the next time.My favorite place."
28.01.2015,5,"excellent hotel in portorose,we stayed there in may,was a fantastic week end.the first thing i liked was the fantastic view on the sea.room very big and clean,staff was very helpfull .there is also a big casino downside.5 stars."
7.01.2015,4,"Hotel is located at the northern tip of Portorož (a bit far from centre) and has a stunning view, specialy if you are lucky enough to get upper floor room.Funny thing with this hotel is that reception - ""ground floor"" is actually on the top of hotel. it is because hotel itself is on the hill, and goes all the way down to the sea level. I stayed in hotel in November, and it was quite nice stay overall. Hotel staff are very easygoing and kind, but professional in the same time, food is good and breakfast choice was ok.Room equipment and whole feeling was not up to 5* standards (rather old rooms that would need refurbishment in following days, old small tv with not so much tv channels,...), i had hmmmm... somewhat 80s feeling inside. But, maybe it's just my point of view. Wifi in my room didnt work, in the lobby it was ok. Lobby is very large, seems too big in fact. Bar is good with good atmosphere, i didn't have the chance to try out the pool, which was on level 9.All in all, when you compare pros and cons, its a good hotel with affordable price."
10.12.2014,5,"I stayed in this hotel 2 nights during end of May '14. wonderful location, breathtaking view. reception in the top and the floors go down to the beach. Excellent service, rooms are small but clean. One must visit in a life time."
30.10.2014,4,Hotel is in nice place and most of the things are OK. Maybee rating of the hotel sets expectations of more that you will receive. Food is fair and staff also in similar level. management should do something more to raise service up where should belong.
23.10.2014,4,"This is one of the finest hotels in slovenian coast...it is placed on the clif and you arrive at the top floors and rooms are below the Reception. The view is magnificent, the pool is small, cosy but just for max 20 people. One of the minuses are the rooms, which are not big enough for 5*, the toilet is nice but not enough for 5*, the beach is also not so good, not even close to beach that 5* hotel should have..."
19.10.2014,3,"I spend there three night son December due to a Congress and everything looked as if the hotel was only open for our group, which was not as big as the hotel. So I dela a little bit out of place there. It might be great in the summer... Price was too expansiva for what we got."
8.10.2014,4,We were here on Our Tour of Venice. Great place on Seashore. A perfect weekend retreat and also a pivotal place for Slovenia tour. Great Sunset and sunrise moods around. Piran tour is a moening walk and evening walk tour with enjoyable Sunset hues.Rooms were well appointed staffsstaffs were very warm and particular. Foods were lipsmacking. We enjoyed Our stay in a great note. Every evenings were great.
1.10.2014,3,"It would get a higher rating if it didn't advertise itself as a 5 star property and didn't charge 5 star prices. Everyone is very efficient and friendly, but things are rather worn. The carpet in our room had been well worn. Also, the gym (or rather what they claim is a gym) is a small forgotten space with some communist era machines. Skip. Also, if you come during a conference, expect long waits for one of only three elevators.Don't expect much space in the rooms. Our Jr. Suite cabin for our cruise was larger with a bigger bathroom and a walk-in closet. This room had no such thing. At least it had a mini-fridge. Only one person at a time in the bathroom.The best thing about the property is the view. And since you are paying for it, get one as high as possible. 9th is the top floor for rooms. Breakfast is on the 10th. Lobby is on the 11th.Tip: The soap in the bathroom is vegetable soap and disintegrates quickly. Ask for extra."
1.10.2014,4,"View is excellent, all rooms are ocean view. All staffs are courteous, professional and effective. Prompt services were provided.Convention center is also new and beautiful. Only problem was elevator-as only 2 available for guests, so too crowded and busy when those meetings at convention center started/end.Business lunches were fairly priced and quality of food was good.I believe most of guests were seniors. You can walk or take a bus to Piran, old town at the tip?of peninsula."
30.09.2014,3,"The hotel is big, can accomodate many guests, at the seaside, friendly service at the reception, nice view from the rooms, very nice terrasse where to enjoy a nice drink, pleasant, very nice breakfast with a lot of choice for all tastes, fresh bread.Parking is free and can accomodate many cars, Internet for free with an ok signal.The location is really good and you will enjoy the drive to Portorose..but the hotel somehow had its best years some years ago and would need a new look, some renovation, especially the rooms, bed was too soft to me, bathroom old, furnitures not modern anymore.. a little old. I would have expected better quality for 120 euros per night."
23.09.2014,4,"Excellent conference facilities. Pleasant service. Buffet got tiresome. Breakfast excellent w good variety of fruits, meats, eggs, omelets. Swimming in Adriatic off dock great. Loads of hot water. Situated near lovely town of Piran with lots of restaurants. Prices so reasonable compared to Venice, Paris etc."
23.09.2014,4,"Recently stayed here for a two-week meeting. The hotel overlooks the Adriatic Sea and Croatia, so you are guaranteed a wonderful view in every room. Service was great and staff were friendly and accommodating. My single room was spacious, clean and the little balconies are lovely for hanging out on and taking in the breathtaking views."
21.09.2014,4,"We stayed in this property three nights in the very end of March. Probably, it used to be a five-star hotel even some 10 years ago, but not any more. The reception area still looks quite presentable, but the rooms are in need of refurbishment. They are just not up to date any more. In fact, we have seen three of them on different floors, because we had to change our room due to strong sewage odour. So we stayed one night in #217 and then two more in the room #518. Rooms on the higher floors have better view, but, in general, they are pretty much the same. Only maybe the colour of the upholstery was different. Like some other guest commented, the bathrooms are indeed smallish and not very comfortable. As to the location, then, of course, it is really wonderful. Along the promenade you can get to the bus stop to Piran. It is possible to walk there, but walking through a parking lot is not a very pleasurable experience. To the other side there is some hotel with a small marina, Wellness center and a tiny shopping street. What really bothered me were the youngsters driving on bikes along the promenade. There is a small beach across the promenade, which looks relaxing and inviting. The inside swimming pool is much too small. The breakfast again was definitely not up to five-star standards, although it was sufficient enough. To sum it up, the best aspects of this hotel are the location and the staff. The service was polite, friendly and professional over the entire premises. The price was also quite reasonable, that is 114 euro per night per room."
2.09.2014,4,"We were so lucky to be here for 6 days. And the sun shone most of the time -apparently rare this year in Slovenia.The hotel is large, all rooms overlook the sea and what a view- staggering. Sunsets are over Venice. We were there during a huge storm too-wind, rain, thunder and lightning that destroyed some of the stairs that take you into the sea. There is no beach as such, but the loungers are by the sea and you go down steps into a clear (and very salty) Aegean! It keeps you buoyant.Rooms are good, spacious, well equipped. Bathrooms are not disabled friendly, Quite how one has a bath I do not know as the shower curtain is static so running a bath involves getting in first!And getting out of the bath isn't easy for someone who is mobility impaired. Water is hot and plentiful. Toiletries are great and plentiful.Breakfasts are amazing. A chef makes omelettes, friend eggs and pancakes. Otherwise everything is available-fruit, cereals, bacon, sausages, salad, cheeses. cold meats, yogurts and all dietary requirements are catered for and loads of different kinds of bread, juices etc. It is a bit of a scramble however- no pun intended.Cafetieres of coffee would be the one improvement I can think of.Décor is a bit old fashioned but everything is cared about and there is a serious attention to detail. Valet parking is available at no extra charge. Towels for the beach and the amazing salt water indoor pool, towelling dressing gowns and slippers are provided. Staff are delightful, really helpful and keen to speak impeccable English.It's not cheap. But worth every penny- there is a free bus into Piran which is such a pretty town. A car is not needed as one can fly into Trieste and get a taxi as it is only about 15km to Piran.I just loved it- both my friend and I did. We hope to return."
2.09.2014,4,"First of all: the location! I couldn't stop taking pictures from the balcony (you see Croatia on one side and Italy on the other) with the different morning and evening light.The hall is on the 11th floor, the restaurant on the 10th, the rooms are on the floors below, all with balcony facing the sea. The room, though not very large and a bit old-fashioned, was clean and comfortable. There is a coffee-maker in the room, but only one -the first- coffee is complimentary (in a double room!): come on, the majority of the hotels of even lower class supply complimentary mineral water and coffee daily (mineral water from the minibar is so expensive as a good wine!). The choice of food at the restaurant is really wide, but all more or less ""international"" dishes with no special taste (the cakes have different ""colours"", but the same taste!) However good, but far from excellent. I loved the private beach. All in all a good hotel, a few doubts about the 5 stars."
20.08.2014,4,"The Grand Bernardin is located on a cliff overlooking the sea, a little off the city centre of Portoroz. It is one of those hotels where the entry level floor is in the middle- not the ground.. (another such entry is that of the Oberoi in Gurgaon, India). It is built in the classic style and very well kept- it has a neat and polished feel about it. We were in a room on one of the higher floors - the views were spectacular, especially at sunset. The beach and the beach bar/restaurants are visible from the room- you just get off the elevator and you are at the beach. The food at the beach restaurant was fresh and tasty- mainly pasta based. The restaurants also offer great views.We had dinner on the terrace, a short walk away but part of the hotel complex- great place for a drink at sunset. The room was spacious but absence of tea/coffee facility was a disappointment,.. surely a great place to stay if you visit Portoroz..Both Portoroz city and the quaint town of Piran are within walking distance.."
16.07.2014,5,"You can tell that this hotel has some years under its belt, nevertheless the quality doesn´t suffer. The rooms are impeccably clean and have been well modernised. The view from the balcony is great and gives a superb atmosphere. The indoor pool is very nice, something special with the salt water. Personnel is very friendly and always ready for service (organised a taxi to go to the casino in the city for free). The buffet offers a lot of variety, so even though you might not like everything and the meals are not superbly spiced, you always find something you like. Breakfast is superb. All in all definitely a recommendation, would come again. Rooms at a higher floor recommended. Only don´t come when there is spring break in Croatia, as the super loud music travels the sea and you can´t sleep (yes, even though it´s in Croatia)."
30.06.2014,3,"Hotel has an impressive location - it looks as if the hotel was chiseled from the cliff it is leaning on.The view from top floors is also sublime.I do recommend you book a room in one of the top floors. Rooms are a bit outdated - at least the ones on the 3rd floor. However they are clean.Food is good. I had breakfast and lunch. A nice variety of dishes.Overall not a bad hotel, but also not a great one. Definitely not worth the money they are asking for. It just lacks a certain lust factor."
28.06.2014,4,"This hotel has it all. Great views over the ocean, access to the beach as you walk out of the elevator (access and beach towels included), free indoor swimming pool, spa and a very friendly and helpful staff. It is a short walk into the nearby town of Piran, and there is also a free shuttle for those who have difficulties walking or are in high heels. The quality of the room and the rest of the hotel was also very high. If I am to mention something which could be improved, I would perhaps have changed the color scheme in the room, which was a bit old fashioned, and I would have liked some real jam for breakfast, and not just something artificial. But when I mention such marginal issues, I realize just how good this hotel is. I came here for a conference, but I would like to come back for a holiday with my kids. I also got o local taxi driver to take me into Croatia (the border is just 10 km away). I would recommend this to anyone."
23.06.2014,4,"During the last 25 years I have visited several times Grand Hotel Bernardin, whether for business or holidays. I like Slovenia, Julian Alps, pleasant Slovenes and Istrian cuisine. This year we stopped here with friends from the automobile club to relax after demanding hikes in the Julian Alps.This Hotel is located just at the point of a peninsula, nearly isolated. No road between seashore and Hotel building. It is a huge complex 11 - floors high leaning on a steep hill .I remember my surprise when I first went from reception glass elevator with views of the sea, down to the high palate to my room. Although the structure of the hotel is a product of the era in which it was built, its location is stunning, all the rooms have sea views. Today, the hotel needs updating, modernization continues slowly. The position of the hotel gives the opportunities to visit Piran and Portoroz (you can walk to both in about 15 minutes or by free bus to Piran city center).The rooms are of medium size, all rooms have a great balcony overlooking the concrete beach and see. Lovely spa, the small fitness center, nice swimming area in the sea in front of the hotel and the indoor pool was good too. Swimming and sunning right at the base of the hotel , lots of restaurants and some diversions .Although the private beach with towels, umbrellas and sun beds is concrete, but there you go directly from the hotel. It's not a very interesting place for lovers of snorkeling, but there can encounter sea urchins. Better beaches are in Portoroz, but in the season there is a lot throughout the day and especially very noisy. If you have enough sun exposure can go on exciting trips. (for example Marina Portoroz, Parco Naturale delle Saline di Sicciole, or go to the port city Kopper.)Food in the hotel is standard. If you want something special I can strongly recommend to have a very good dinner in Piran. There are a few very good restaurants along the water front (for example the fish restaurant Pavel or Ivo). The atmosphere on the restaurant's terrace was very nice. The personnel was nice, the price was reasonable and the seafood was great! Dinner with our business partners we had in the restaurant Marina in Portoroz. In this comfortable and pleasant restaurant with a magnificent view, only a few metres from the sea, you can try the excellent Mediterranean and seafood dishes as well as the high-quality wines from top producers of the Primorska region.On the way home we visited a jewel of nature – Postojna Caves. It has been 5 years since I last visited Postojna Caves, and it has changed. It was a tourist attraction then, but even more so now. The major turn off was the heavy commercialization of the caverns. There were too many people inside the cave and many of them were rude and obnoxious. The very impressive thing about the cave is its size. But this is already another story. If I ever had the opportunity to visit Portoroz, I would definitely be staying at this hotel."
13.06.2014,5,Beautiful city good hotel with good ambience and service. Courteous staff. In all a pleasant experience . I would strongly recommend this place to all tourists and friends.Why is portoroz not so well known among tourist circles?Surely should be on itinerary of travellers to Northern Italy and while in portoroz the base should be Grand Bernardin.
27.05.2014,5,"I was 3 day in may in this hotel. Very exclusive hotel, very professional and most hospitable staff. delicious food, nice meeting cabinet. Beautiful location on seaside resort, very clean and tidy hotel beach."
25.05.2014,5,"This is my favourite hotel. I find it the most beautiful at the Slovenian cost. The view is just excellent. Sitting at the the terrace in the morning, have a cup of coffee, looking at the see you can feel the calm and all problems just disapeare. Sometimes I drive to this hotel just to have a coffee there.I have been on holidays in this hotel a few times in the past, now mostly participate in conferences there.Rooms are spacious, all with balcony with the sea view. But as they haven't been renovated lately they need to be - regarding that this is a 5* hotel. But they have everything that the guest can need.I was told that the hotel will be renovated probably in autumn. Great.Lobby is great, very big with piano bar and a terrace - as already mentioned. Very, very beautiful.Convention center is the best in Slovenia by my opinion. Very big, different meeting rooms, very good service. Have a conference there is the best choice.They also have a pool and different massage saloons but I have never used them.Breakfast is also that mustbe mentioned . Very, very good, great choice, just perfect. Restaurant is big, spacious, clean and also with a great view.Staff is very kind and helpful.I will keep on coming to this hotel whenever I can."
21.05.2014,4,"It's one of the few hotels where you enter the hotel on the Top floor and go down to your rooms.Excellent Conference rooms, fantastic view of the Mediterranean sea. very good rooms and very good staff.Unique experience for our conference group was a grand welcome by traditional dance by senior couples while we were registering!Location of this hotel is unique."
17.12.2013,4,"we came there for a conference, not sightseeing. The rooms remember the communist times, but they don't miss anything important. We had a view on the bay and that was breathtaking. Restaurant was cosy due to the low season, we enjoyed the food. the pool is tiny with a great view and salty water! conference facilities are very practical"
8.12.2013,5,"Very nice hotel in one of the nicest location! Amazing view from the rooms with balcony. You feel like cruising in a sea. We stay with half board and breakfast was usual with many choices of cheese and cold meat, omelet and veggies, fruits and Slovenian fresh yogurt with homemade jam. We went for dinner at 9 and they serve us from the menu not buffet style dinner. It was really nice dinner with delicious traditional dishes. Spa was great! Tea room after treatments "" must do "" ! Very nice bar downstairs. Friendly staff. Very quick service! Recommend for two because there is nothing to do for kids. Total relaxing 5 star hotel."
4.12.2013,4,"This Hotel is located just at the point of a peninsula, nearly isolated. No road between seashore and Hotel building. It is a huge complex-11 floors high leaning on a steep hill. You enter right on top Level, where the reception is located and then move downward by Elevator to your assigned floor and room. The rooms are of medium size, quite nice. Bed is good and the Environment is very calm and natural - good sleep garanted. What is really spectacular- when you sit on the balcony high directly above the seashore . The bathroom is fine, nothing special to be reported.What is really excellent: the Food. We had dinner buffet and selection and taste were definitely above expectation. Same is true about breakfast: good coffee and excellent offer in quantity and Quality. Very interesting: Fonda's bio-fishfarm for seabass nearby and salt mines."
21.11.2013,3,"While being settled in a marvelous location the hotel is unfortunately tired. It had better times and needs a thorough renovation.Nevertheless I'd share some details:1) Before going do review the price offers (eg, via booking.com the price was better than directly with the hotel) even if you visit a conference there.2) Reception is attentive and helpful. 3) Rooms outdated with the very small bathroom (no separate shower cabin). It is advisable to ask rooms on higher floors (due to pleasant view) and to avoid a sewage smell from outside (my colleague complained about that).4) Restaurant is fine, but decoration is rather old-fashionable. Breakfast is good (coffee not). 5) Parking is free for guests. Be aware that you have to take a card from reception to exit parking (no sign, no info when arrived from reception unfortunately, made an empty run to take a car).6) It is less than 5 mins walk from the ground floor (which is on a seaside) till free bus to Piran city centre (goes frequently 7am-11pm as I remember).All in all the hotel is acceptable for conferences (due to good conference facilities and enough space) but I'd give a thought if going there privately."
7.10.2013,4,"I spent a couple of nights at the hotel as I was attending a conference in October, which is pretty much 'off-season'.A pity the pool was under maintenance, but then again, the sea was still available for a swim. Just at the back of the hotel, you have a particular area for sunbathing and swimming. Dressing gowns and slippers were available in the room.I didn't try the spa inside of the hotel either, so I can't comment on that. A colleague was quite surprised (in the positive way) of the gym-area, so I guess that was fine as well.Breakfast times are from 7 till 11 and there's a wide variety in offered food. However, my 'english' breakfast never got completed and the same sausages did taste a wee bit different the day after. I didn't have other lunches or meals in the hotel, as there are plenty of restaurants in the area offering something for everyone.The service was good as well, I only had to contact a few times the staff and they were happy to help me out.Wifi was pretty stable as well.There's a bus-stop nearby to the north if you want to go and visit Piran (close enough to go on foot as well) which is a free navette and there's another one nearby eastwards, from the public bus transport, if you want to go whichever direction.Going further down to the south, there are some bicycle rentals, in case you'd want to cross the border with Croatia, which is less than 10 km away. I didn't find one really close to the hotel, but I guess that's just because it's off-season."
4.10.2013,4,"Came here for a conference and although in need of a little updating, it is fine for a holiday. Having said that it seems that the majority of visitors were either there for conferences or as part of a coach/holiday tour. Lovely spa, nice swimming area in the sea in front of the hotel and the indoor pool was good too. The fitness centre was a little too small. It needs more equipment.The room I had was clean and tidy, just a little too warm - the air conditioning wasn't terribly efficient, but as I visited not in the height off the summer, it was bearable. The balcony is very nice, and lovely to sit on in the afternoon with a long, tall cold drink.The room could do with tea making facilities and more English channels on the TV. At least BBC World News or one of the American news channels apart from just CNN.Love the dressing gowns and slippers, essential as you have to leave the hotel to go to swim in the sea.The restaurants are rather overpriced and the buffet for 22 euros is terrible value for the quality of the food. You would be better off coming out of the hotel turning left towards Portoroz and eating at the ""News Cafe"" (about 5 mins walk away) - cheap and edible!The breakfast buffet needs a lift. It looks and tastes old fashioned as if it was cooked in the 1970s!Choices for breakfast are a lot, but they are the same every day. I was only there for 7 nights, and I got bored of the food. Really? - 4 different types of sausages? How about baked beans and fried potatoes for a change? Waffles? Sautéed mushrooms? It's great to have 4 different types of strawberry yogurt, but at the end of the day they are still just strawberry yogurt!!On the plus side there are lots of different types of sliced cold meat and ham, and cheese and there is a person who makes pancakes for you whilst you wait - brilliant! Maple syrup would be good though.The hotel is almost equidistant between Piran and Portoroz. I prefer Piran; quaint and not so touristy. Portoroz appeared to me to be a little too ""chavvy"" ! You can get to Piran by the free bus, but the walk will only take about 15 mins. Nice restaurants, particularly ""Pavels"".Overall, the hotel is lovely and if you like hotel based holidays it's the place for you. No sandy beaches but good swimming. Hell of a long way from Ljubljana but worth it."
4.10.2013,4,"I spent four nights at this hotel in October 2013, attending a conference. Consequently, my review will be a little different since I wasn't here during the tourist season and didn't really experience many of the hotel amenities. However, what I did see and enjoy was well done. I could see this would be a great location to vacation - swimming and sunning right at the base of the hotel, lots of restaurants and some diversions within a few kilometers (the hotel is between Piran and Portoroz, but one can walk to both in about 15 minutes). There is a full-service spa at the hotel and although I wasn't there it seemed to be of a high standard (but expect also to pay the market price for the services). Hotel staff were professional and accommodating, although one day I did have to contact housekeeping as the room had not been made up. The room was typical but came with quite a few little extras and had a great balcony overlooking the 'concrete beach' and water. The breakfast was very good with plenty of variety. I took no other meals in the restaurant and frankly it seemed a little 'cold' or formal for such a seaside resort. I believe they try to make a five-star hotel out of one that is four-star. It isn't the former but certainly is the latter."
22.09.2013,5,"Excellent hotel. Located between Portoroz and Piran. Beautiful sea views from all rooms. Excellent spacious balconies. Private beach, free sunbeds and umbrellas. Indoor pool is very nice. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice."
8.09.2013,4,"Excellent hotel , probably the best in Portoroz - Piran for a beach holiday . Private beach with towels , umbrellas and sun beds (Go pedestrian street )All rooms with sea view, excellent spacious balconies . Good breakfast , lots of parking priotele . excellent wireless internet signal. The center of Piran, 15 minutes on foot"
27.08.2013,5,"One of only a few great hotels of Slovenian Riviera. Located between Portorose (casinos, sandy beach, not so existing nightlife) and charming old town of Piran - both about 15 mins walk away. Hotel in need of update, but still with good, clean rooms and very good service. Sea view is simply spectacular. Breakfast with plenty of choice, but nit very tasteful. Hotel concrete beach is probably the most luxurious you can find in this part of Adriatic, especially premium sector which is charged at 15 euros. Indoor pool very nice but too small and often over-crowded."
22.08.2013,4,"A large hotel in an ideal location between Piran and Portoroz. All the rooms look out to sea, but you might want to request a higher floor beforehand to get the best views. The reception and restaurant staff were all very helpful. The rooms are good quality without being spectacular. If you have the half-board package you'll find there's a wide range of good quality food. The hotel is part of quite a large complex including several swimming pools, bars and shops which makes for some extra options if you don't wish to go further afield all the time.It's a bit of a shame, given that there are several pools that one of them couldn't be adult only (they're all quite busy). The indoor pool in the hotel itself is very nice, but quite small. The 'beach' is mainly a concrete promenade, but is actually quite good with spaces always available and access to swimming in the sea.Although officially part of Portoroz, the hotel is closer to Piran (15 minutes very pleasant and flat walk along the seafront). The walk to Portoroz in the opposite direction is about 20 minutes again flat and along the seafront. There is a 'land train' that runs past the hotel and to Piran / Portoroz at regular intervals, though the ride is a little bumpy. Alternatively, there's regular bus services close to the hotel and if you want to cut short your walk to Piran there's a free shuttle bus from a car park five minutes from the hotel to the square at Piran. Whichever way you cut it there's plenty of options to get to both resorts (including hiring cycles) and unless you really want to be in either resort, I think this hotel is the ideal and best location.If you have time you should really consider trips to the capital Ljubjana and both large lakes Bled and Bohinj. All were really good. The only problem we had was actually finding organised trips, especially to the lakes where we had to accompany a Russian trip (although luckily we did get some commentary in English). Unfortunately, there's not a lot of long distance public transport - not many trains and the buses are very slow. So if you do want to visit the above you'll probably need to find organised trips or hire a car. If you have more time Venice, Trieste and Rovinj (highly recommended) are all within easy reach. I'd suggest that if you wanted to visit all of the above places and still have time to relax in the hotel and locally, then 10-14 days would be ideal.Piran and Portoroz are very different but make for a very nice contrast. Piran is a small Venetian town with winding alleyways and lots of bars and restaurants. It is very small but makes for a very relaxing place to wander around. As you'd expect there are lots of fish and seafood restaurants mostly offering similar fare (we had a warm welcome and good value food at the Pirat). One tip is to go to the rooftop bar terrace at the art deco interior-styled Hotel Tartini (you don't need to be a guest). At night this gives a lovely view over Piran.Portoroz is bigger and more modern, but not without charm. You can happily walk along the seafront and take a drink in one of the many bars. When we were there we luckily found the men's Wimbledon final on at the tennis club at the far end of the town, which made for a very enjoyable afternoon. All the locals we met were very friendly and mostly speak very good English - the same goes for the tour guides and hotel staff.Slovenia has a bit of everything, whether you want Mediterranean sunshine, alpine lakes or a cultural small capital city. It's a small country with a lot to offer and Piran / Portoroz offer a great base to explore both the rest of the country and neighbouring Italy and Croatia. And I think the Bernardin offers a very good place to relax and take advantage of both the local environment and the attractions further afield."
19.08.2013,5,"When I first visited this hotel five years ago it was ok but in the mean time they improved greatly! Last time we stayed, there were some issues with the beach but now it is solved.So, where to start? The rooms are large, beds comfortable and immaculately clean. The view..well it is the best part of Adriatic so the view and the smell of the pine threes are pure joy. The position of the hotel gives the opportunities to visit both Piran and Portoroz. The free bus to and from Piran is excellent idea. There is free internet and free parking.We stayed 3 nights, food is very good, diverse, plenty. Staff is very kind, both in the reception, beach or dining area. I only feel sorry for the beach boys because they are being constantly bullied by some rude guests. I love this place but must say it is not for children. It is not really family hotel, fine by me I have no kids, so I spent a great time there, better then five years ago."
19.08.2013,4,"This hotel exceeded my expectations as I had read some mixed reviews on Trip Advisor. We were given an upgrade to a huge suite so things got off to a very good start. The décor in the room is quite dated but not shabby or untidy in any way, and everywhere was extremely clean. The bathroom was large, modern and had a wonderful flexible make up mirror with light (great for putting my contact lenses in and out!) There is free wi-fi in the bedrooms.The breakfast came with ample choice and a chef serving fresh egg dishes but it was very busy in the area at times.We did not have lunch or dinner in the hotel but we had some cocktails in the bar – unfortunately, these were only average in quality and very expensive in price.The views from the hotel rooms are superb and the beach in front of the hotel has a large, safe roped off area in the sea, which I really liked. The warm salt water swimming pool is also nice but there is an extra charge of 15 Euros if you want to use the sauna – a bit expensive, in my opinion.Easy 15 minute walk into Piran so good for sightseeing as well as swimming/beachOverall, a very enjoyable stay in this hotel."
18.08.2013,4,"We were warmly greeted for our two night stay and were subsequently upgraded for various reasons. The rooms are slightly dated in style but are not shabby e.g. the furnishings have been kept neat and tidy. The breakfast is what I would describe as 'mass catering' and is a little bit of a rat race in the morning but there is a good selection of choice and the quality is reasonable. Tea and coffee are popular so it would be good if there was a couple more machines, perhaps in a different area of the restaurant. We ordered some cocktails in the bar on the first night- they were the most expensive we had on our trip and were probably some of the poorest quality. I don't object paying more for an excellent cocktail but it is a bit cheeky to charge so 9 euros for low quality. Pool and beach are lovely and the hotel itself is well placed between Piran and Portoroz. To go into the sauna/wellness centre, you need to pay extra which seems a bit cheeky.Overall a good hotel, fairly pricey but we did go in the peak of the season so better bargains to be had slightly off peak."
16.08.2013,5,"We spent few days in Grand hotel Bernardin in May 2013. The hotel is great, with a lovely bar on the roof and a modern pool on the 10th floor. Rooms are big and bright, wit a wonderfull sea view.The location of hotel is great. In only few minutes walking you can reach Piran or Portorož. There is also a tourist-train, which drives from hotel to Piran.We really enjoyed here, and we hope that someday we go back again."
28.07.2013,5,"We booked this hotel for a short weekend break with my husband, spent 2 nights there. Hotel location is really perfect, and rooms are having beautiful sea view. Especially liked the lift with panoramic view! Hotel is having its own beach, which is not crowded, even in main season there are free places there. Hotel has a ""premium"" beach as well, which costs 15 EUR/person/day and you get lots of extra services, e.g. cold mineral water, ice cream, champaigne, cold towels with lavender and premium sunbeds. Rooms and bedrooms are rather small but for us it was not a problem at all. Breakfast was perfect with wide choice (quality of coffee was not that good, anyway...). Cleaning was okay. Inside wellness area is very beautiful, only critic I can make is that inside pool had salty sea water. Terrace bar on the top of the hotel is also perfect with beautiful view (and here the coffee is also good)."
14.07.2013,4,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 7 nights after spending 2 nights in Ljubljana beforehand.Having selected Piran as the destination for our summer break we struggled to find a hotel that matched our usual requirements.Although we were a little nervous about the tripadvisor reviews we went ahead & booked because of the hotel's location, an easy walk to Piran but not right in the centre of town.The hotel interior whilst being somewhat dated with heavy furnishings, carpets & drapes, we actually found to be quite homely & to have a certain charm. All areas of the hotel were kept immaculately clean at all times.Our room was adequate & was kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay, the bathroom was a little on the small side but perfectly functional & the view out to sea was breathtaking.The hotel offered a pleasant buffet dining experience at both breakfast & dinner with a good choice, regular replenishment of food to keep it fresh & we particularly liked being allocated the same table for our entire stay for our evening meal.All hotel staff were polite, friendly & efficient at all times.The area by the sea was very well maintained with ample sunbeds & umbrellas available, safe access to the water & staff were on hand throughout the day & always willing to help with moving beds & umbrellas.This hotel is perfectly located for exploring the lovely town of Piran."
3.07.2013,5,"Hotel offers exceptional view on the Bay of Piran. It is located on half between Portorož and Piran, and thus ideal for nice walks along the coast. The service is superb and meals very rich in their variety. Pity that we didn't use the beach, since the sea was still too cold, but more the indoor swimming pool, which is nice, filled with sea water and located at the 9th floor, where our room was. Nevertheless when you exit hotel, you are immediately at the beach. Due to our 15 months old daughter, we were in the centre of the attention of the guests and staff, which gave the feeling that we were really welcomed."
25.06.2013,3,"My immediate family I stayed at this ""5 star"" hotel with some of my European relatives. To say it is a 5 star is somewhat misleading. I would clearly say it is a solid 3 star...We were issued an actual key to our room, rather than most 5 stars that have electro-magnet cards. You can easily tell that the hotel is slowly on the decline and it not up to par for the modern ages. It is really a shame too. But, for the price you pay to stay here...I am sure there are better hotels in the vicinity.The Breakfast and dinners were great though...."
9.06.2013,3,"I am coming to this hotel for at least past 15 years. Nothing changed in the meantime (except decoration of the terrace bar and conference facilities). 15 years a go I would rate it as excellent, now I am between poor and average. Because of the service and location I am giving average, however, if nothing changes next year I will give poor. Now for the hotel: wounderful view. Staff mostly nice, although the waters in the terrace bar sometimes too familiar. Good breakfast. Cons: same rooms as 15 years a go - although ok, very poor compared to the price, no wi fi, small pool, very expensive for the experience."
8.06.2013,2,"sorry, the only thing i dont like in hotels 4 or 5 * is that they have plastic fantastic flower for decoration, if you pay the most expensive price to be there i aspect to smell real flower power;)& another policy of hotel about not care about fisical person on reception, that they have to answer 2 phones before they say hello to you, cause person on phone wont call back?so funny, right;)"
27.05.2013,3,"As other reviewers posted already this hotel has a nice staff, but the building itself is very tired and needs renovation. They are facing the huge problems with sewage which causes the terrible smell along the hotel's corridors. Bathrooms and rooms are very small and outdated, but the views are magnificent. Housekeeping could do their job much better, while the food at the main restaurant was good, but not on the 5* level."
26.05.2013,5,"This fairly luxurious hotel offers very nice accommodation and a very good breakfast (and good value). The hotel is built against a hill so, unusually, the street entrance is at the top, while the exit to the waterfront is at the bottom. For the same reason, all bedrooms face the sea.Despite its address, the hotel is very convenient for Piran (and a longer walk from the centre of Portoroz). If you exit at the bottom and turn right along the waterfront, you can walk to the centre of Piran in about 15 minutes. Alternatively, just a few minutes walk from the hotel, you will reach a car park from where a frequent (free) bus runs right into the centre of Piran. The best meal we had was at Gostilna Pri Mari, which is on the right as you walk into Piran - but it is a small restaurant where booking is adviseable."
20.03.2013,5,"I was here in July 2007 and August 2009 and I can say, that I will be back again. This hotel is located not so far from downtown, but very close to the sea, in a very quiet and green area. Somehow this hotel is linked with Histrion hotel - and here you have a Spa, and a small marina. Big and well equipped rooms with huge balcony. For those which they looking for a quiet holiday, with some Spa moments and boating days - this is the best option from Portoroz.In front of this hotel you will find a very good sea food restaurant - La Barca - nice sea view, good kitchen."
9.03.2013,4,We spent 7 days with the family in this beatiful hotel with a perfect wiew. The hotel is located in the perfect location with a beautiful wiew on sea side. Stuff is wey very helpfull. The food is ok.Also the service si good and corect. A small spa is very clean with good staff. I recomanded thishotel for business -seminars or maybe convetnions....
23.01.2013,4,"I stayed in the GH Bernardin for business purposes couple of times. It has great sea view rooms, great food, stuff is helpfull and there are great business facilities for seminars, convetnions etc. Hotel has a small spa, which is very private. A small souvenir shop is well stocked with local (Slovenian) souvenirs. The only thing that bothered was that my room was just above the banquete hall and the music couldd be heared through the walls."
19.01.2013,4,"I spent 4 days with my girlfriend in GH Bernardin from 25.12. Hotel is built 30 years ago but stuff is maintaining it very nice. All rooms have sea view, which is great, food is ok, people are friendly, Portoroz is beautiful place for relaxation. Hotel is ideal for business gathering."
18.10.2012,4,"I visited the hotel together with 60+ colleagues over a weekend with great pleasure. The hotel gives good value, great surroundings and good service. I would however consider more than once to book the hotel for a family trip since it is a bit ... boring to be honest."
3.10.2012,5,"With my husband we went to Portor this summer, as we were travelling a lot. Comparing Greece and Portor is really funny, as we do have much more beautiful beaches.On the other hand, there was an excellant hospitality from the hotel, which we did like so much, specially the spa and the swimming pool, thank you very much for our stay.Eleni and Dimitris."
29.09.2012,4,"I have participated 50 people conference organised in this hotel. Hotel provides perfect view (all rooms face sea and bay), and is nicly surouned. Service is great! All the people were very kind and helpful. But in the room you will see the hotel was build in late 70ties. So, I would recommend this place for the group event, but not necessarily for family holidays."
23.09.2012,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stated at GBH. The front desk staff were quite helpful. The view of the sea was amazing. I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast - lots of healthy choices. The dinner at the in-hotel restaurant was a bit expensive, but I found some comfortable and affordable restaurants withing a couple minutes walk of the hotel (e.g. take a right as you come out of the ground floor, look for the restaurant that is labeled as ""Pizzeria"", they have plenty of sandwiches). I left my watch in the hotel room by accident. Called them about it when I got home 2 weeks later and they happily mailed it to me in the U.S. The valet parking was quick and simple. The ocean swimming was fun, but I prefer to be indoors so I took advantage of the indoor ""infinity pool"". My family also took advantage of the in-house spa which they seemed to enjoy a lot.Thanks for a fantastic stay!"
30.08.2012,2,"I stayed here for 5 nights, and I have to say my stay in this hotel was the worst part of my trip. The view from your hotel room will be simply amazing, however, the view is the only thing amazing about this hotel. Upon arrival, you will quickly notice that the hotel staff will go through great lengths to get you to only use their overpriced and incredibly underwhelming services, and at the expense of your enjoyment. And as one guest mentioned above in another review, the staff treat you like the enemy, and almost unapproachable. The staff will never smile, never greet you, and you'll be left wondering they types of guests who came in before you who caused the staff to act like they do. The rooms are very small, and decorated in early Soviet ugly - I thought Borat was going to greet me on my hotel balcony with a hammer and sickle. The amenities are mediocre - they claim to have WiFi, but if your internet connection doesn't work, you'll find yourself frustrated trying to find a person who cares enough to help you fix it. My recommendation - go to the concierge and yell at them (literally) until they provide you with internet access - by my 4th night, I could get online. It seems they forgot to flip the switch for internet to my room. Coincidentally, my internet started working after I yelled at the gentleman behind the concierge's desk. The rooms have a strange odor - similar to the hallways. For a hotel that is so incredibly large and located on the beach, it is completely indoors - the hallways have probably not had fresh air in decades. If you are planning to come to Portoroz with friends or family and you have an extremely busy agenda that allows you to spend as little time as possible in this hotel, I would then recommend you stay at the Grand Hotel Bernardin. However, if you're planning to spend even 1 morning in this hotel, seek elsewhere. In concluding, it's obvious they try very very hard to be a luxurious hotel, which they're not, and it's simply cheesy. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location.Details below on my first night of horror:On my first night, I arrived late from the airport, was tired, and simply wanted something to eat. I asked the concierge about the local restaurants in the area, seeing as that is a common question to ask concierge services at a hotel in the US. However, they wouldn't provide me with any information other than the location of their restaurant on the 10th floor, which was filled with guests dressed in tuxedos. I just spent more than 10 hours on an airplane, was very tired and hungry, and I didn't want to get dressed up for dinner, so I opted to walk around the town. That was a complete failure since it was completely dark outside and I had no idea where I was going. 10 minutes into my walk, I turned around and reluctantly ordered room service which cost me 70 Euro. 70 Euro gets you a mediocre bottle of wine and a chicken filet."
22.07.2012,3,"I stayed 7 nights at this hotel, half board service.For a 5 star hotel I would have expected better rooms, and definitely much better food, whosequality was rather low, both at breakfast and dinner.The exit to the beach is just on the seashore: it is not a beach, but a cement levelling which can be rather hot and uncomfortable during the hot noon hours.My room (on the second floor) was at times rather smelly due to the sewage odor seeping from downstairs through the ventiduct on the floor of my bathroom.Same foul odor I smelled - especially early in the morning- at street level, when crossing from the hotel to the cement explanade (beach)"
13.07.2012,5,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel in July and could very easily have spent more! Having driven up from Croatia and sussing out all the resorts on the Slovenian coast we settled on this gorgeous hotel in Portoroz. We were made to feel very welcome and were shown the room before checkin to ensure it was satisfactory- a lovely big room, comfortable bed and balcony with sea view ensured it most definitely was! We opted for the half board option and weren't disappointed; the hotel restaurant has a great variety of food and has waiter table service to ensure your drinks are always topped up. If we could have had an all inclusive option we would have taken it but were told this was unavailable.The hotel has a private shale beach and towels are complimentary. The lifeguard ensures everyone has a lounger and even though the hotel was busy this was never a problem.Piran is within walking distance and when the heat got too much we wandered through to Piran centre and browsed through the gorgeous fishing villiage. The hotel also runs a complimentary shuttle and there is a novelty train which runs regularly from the hotel to Piran centre for 3.50euro return.Another bonus is that there is a lot of onsite parking which is free of charge.All in all I really could not fault this amazing hotel and definitely plan a return visit."
26.06.2012,4,"This hotel is located just in front of the sea, you just have to go down to the zero floor and dive. All the rooms have balconies with a beautiful view and perfect to sunbathe in the afternoon. The rooms are nice and clean but for a five star hotel I would expect more. There are no real double beds, just 2 single together. For a deeper relaxation I would recommend the spa, which is quite nice and has reasonable prices. I drink in at the terrace bar is also enjoyable. There is a wide variety for conference rooms and the service is excellent. All the meals I had were also quite nice. The overall location is also very good, between Piran and Portoroz, with many dinning and bar options."
12.05.2012,5,"This is perhaps one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed. The location is right on the ocean with most rooms overlooking the ocean/lake area. The food was outstanding. The rooms are clean and well equpped. The restaurant was superb not only in food but also in service. The hotel employees were extremely generous, polite and very helpful."
11.05.2012,3,"I spent five nights here in May, attending a conference. The seaside location is lovely, and all rooms have balconies overlooking the sea. Two small towns (Portoroz and Piran) with (limited) shopping but numerous dining options, are short walks from the hotel. It is clear that the hotel does a lot of conference business. The hotel conference services seemed responsive and appropriate, with well-maintained conference rooms, excellent coffee breaks, good climate control, all necessary audio-visual equipment, and efficient set-up. Breakfast was also good, in a large, airy room with sea views. One dinner we had in the hotel was nicely catered with several vegetarian options. All staff I encountered were courteous and helpful. Bath towels were large and fluffy, and the room was very clean. Light was adequate for reading and working. Other aspects of the rooms, however, left something to be desired. The bed in my tiny third-floor room was one of the worst I have encountered anywhere, with what appeared to be mattress springs poking up through the top. There are no coffee/tea-making facilities in the rooms, nor iron/ironing board, which is unusual for a hotel that caters to so many business guests (for conferences). And the fitness room hours are quite limited - 0900 to 2100. This means one cannot use the equipment before the conference sessions begin, and typically one cannot use them at night after dinner either, because they close so early. While this was a good hotel for a conference, I would not recommend it for a holiday."
15.11.2011,4,"Complete resort! Casino, restaurants, spa! Perfect location for a business convention. Relaxing spa, wide variety of conference rooms, and nice bar. Great sunsets, all seaview rooms. Close to Italy, or if in Venice, just a couple hours drive. Friendly staff. The building needs renovating on the outside and maybe modernising of interiors."
14.09.2011,1,"Terrible staff, old fashioned, small, ouotdated rooms. Breakfast served in a dark room, staff service absolutly terrible! If you want to go to the hotel beach, you need cards from the reception, with which you get towels. They treat you like an enemy. For the price of 216 euro, you dont feel any welcome at all. Horrible 2 star service, like nothing has changed from the socialist time. 'For 5 star hotel and for 216 Euro, very big dissapointment. Go somewhere else!"
4.09.2011,4,"The nicest part is the terace at lobby level, where you can enjoy the beautiful views and a nice drink. The rest of the hotel suffers a lack of style and atmosphere through its lack a design. It is just a big concrete temple build at a prestine location. Ofcourse the service level is excellent and the food is of a good quality, you cant blame the staff for the building. So all in all you dont have the 5* feeling."
11.08.2011,4,"in my opinion, this is most beautiful Hotel in Slovenia, and maybe most beautiful hotel in the east europe ... splendid inside (interior), gorgeous beach, Portoroz is very lovely city, aprox. 50 m from hotel is free bus to Piran, which is beautiful historical city, etc, etc ... buffet lunch/supper was hearty & varied & tasty ...I stay in the double room with kids, me and husband in the one room and kids in the second room. Between two ours rooms was connecting door. Listen to me good ! Hotel staff DECLINE/refused to lend me the keys between my room and kids room !!! I could not have children under control, this is very unpleasant, I had to go out into the hallway and then knocking on the door of children. :-(( toilet/bathroom without exhaust fan .. :-((if you would like to visit trieste in Italy, please be aware of this: In the Sunday, DO NOT exist bus/train connection between Portoroz and Trieste, have to use taxi or boat."
10.08.2011,4,"Architecturally already a little bit outdated and also requiring a little bit of renovation when the rooms are concerned the hotels offers a splendid view over the Bay of Piran from within all guest rooms. Service is very friendly at checkin and checkout, breakfast service however was non-existant neither coffee nor tea were served - everything had to be taken from the buffet by yourself."
2.08.2011,4,"I was concerned when I read previous reviews about this hotel, but having returned from 2 week stay I can honestly say it is first rate. Travelled to this part of the world will know that a 5 star hotel here does not equate to a 5 star in the UK - so be prepared for a 4 start - but its sportlessly clean, fantastic beach area and the food is very fresh, plentifull and tasty. If you want romantic ambience for your evening meal you won't get it here as its buffet style, but now that eating out in Europe is so expensive, we found the vast selection of hot and cold food for both breakfast and Dinner to be very acceptable and we saved our money for going into Piran afterwards for a few drinks. The hotel is about 15 minute walk away from Piran (about 30 minutes from Portoroz) and there is a free bus from the adjacent ""Park & Ride"" as cars are only allowed in Piran with a permit. Overall a good quality hotel that had all we wanted. Yes we did detect a very occasional smell of drains on the waterfront - but we have experienced this in very many other ""5 star"" adriatic hotels and it is fleeting and does not detract from the location."
1.08.2011,4,"I was concerned to read some of the bad reviews given this hotel, but having just returned fromn 2 week holiday there I can honestly say everything was first rate. The position is superb - 10 minute walk into Piran. The hotel and bathing areas are spotless and the staff are very attentive. I think some people expect a 5 star hotel in this area to be the same as one in the UK - most seasoned travellers to this part of the world know that its probably akin to 4 star. Saying that though the food was good, fresh & plentifull and although the buffet style would not give you the romantic ambience some people would wish, in this day and age of eating out in Europe being prohibitively expensive, we were more than satisfied to eat at the hotel each night and save our money for visiting a few bars in Piran afterwards. We only had a couple of instances of smelling ""drains"" and that was no worse or better than other coastal hotels we have visited in hot countries - and it definitely will not detract from your stay and is no indication of standard of cleanliness - our experience was that everying was spot on. Only quibble was that the bar costs in the hotel were very expensive, so we didn't spend much time there!"
11.10.2010,3,"Stayed there for 5 nights.Room was OK in terms of amenities. In terms of size it was rather small. The balcony overlooking the beautiful Portoroz bay was particularly nice.However, as rooms face westwards they get a lot of sun all day long thus getting particularly hot in spite of the max outside temperature in early Oct reaching into the low 20's.This brings me to one major downside, the A/C, which doesn't produce any change in the room's temperature even after having worked in full power mode for half a day.In October you could leave the balcony door open which would help a lot making the air inside the room breathable but was wondering what options one has, -other than changing the hotel- in mid-August when the temperature goes up into 40's and the existing A/C is useless.I can only confirm the issue with the sewage stench. It wasn't though as present and overwhelming as stated in the previous comments, nevertheless was just as annoying when crept inside the bathroom or was felt on the sea promenade in front of the hotel.Breakast was OK.The outdoor bar terrace on the lobby floor has magnificent views of the bay and the nearby Portoroz city centre.Staff is OK, though sometimes struggling to understand English being spoken at them.The only excellent service the hotel provides is free high speed (and I do mean HIGH SPEED!) internet connection. This is way ahead of many other hotels of similar category.The location of the Hotel is ok. It's within walking distance to Piran and Portoroz city centre (15-20 mins in either direction). There are also free busses connecting with Piran from the hotel's adjoining public parking area by the sea shore.In other words the hotel scores average in pretty much all aspects of its offering. Pondering all aspects of its offering to me it appears as a good 4-star hotel, definitely not a 5. If you look at it this way you will not be dissapointed. However the pricing is steep related to the offering. At 200 eur per night for a double you could get a a hotel that's closer to fulfiling the 5-star ranking than Bernardin.Other than this, the Piran area is fantastic. The nature looks are fab. One can travel by car to Italy (Trieste and some small villages down that part of the coast) or to Croatia (especially to the beautiful little towns of Rovinj and Pola) and just as well inland to Lipica the home of famous Lipizzan horse breed and to the largest cave in Europe at Postojna.I would return there for holiday with the family but would choose a different hotel."
8.09.2010,3,"The hotel has excellent location and nice room view .Stench of sewage around the hotel and in the room was unbearable. This is unacceptable for a 5-star hotel. Last morning, we literally ran from the room in which was unable to breath."
1.09.2010,3,"I agree with others - it is not 5 stars hotel - food is poor and low quality (cheep), stuff is unfriendly - when I took umbrella, a boy told me that I have to return it!!!!! So rude! Rooms are rather small and wardrobe not big enough. There is no facility for drying wet swimming suits. Carpets are old and smelly. Beaches are nice and they did a good work. Location is excellent, only 10 minutes from Piran, beautiful old and original place and 15-20 minutes from Portorose."
25.07.2010,4,"I have stayed at Grand Hotel Bernadin several times, always for a short trip in spring. It is in a very good location, directly at the sea between Piran and Portoroz. All rooms have direct sea view and a balcony. From the outside, the hotel is rather ugly (entirely built in concrete) but rooms are nice and very clean. The hotel has a rather new wellness center and spa, opened in 2009. I only tried the indoor pool there, which is not big but has a splendid view over the sea (especially recommended at sunset). The hotel next to Grand Hotel Bernardin has a very large indoor pool area which is suitable for children and can be used free of charge, if I remember correctly (the two hotels belong to the same hotel group.)I only had beakfast buffet at the hotel which is good but not overwhelming. I din't like the coffee, which you have to take from a coffee dispenser. But they offer a wide range of fresh fruit, and the selection of cakes etc. is also good. I have never tried dinner at the hotel as there are a lot of very good (fish-) restaurants in Piran. It's a 15 minute walk from the hotel. I would definitely recommend to eat in one of the restaurants there at night. By the way, Piran is one of the nicest spots at the Adria, small venetian town, very pittoresque!Hotel staff is in general very helpful and nice. Reception staff speaks English and German, and I think also Italian.If you want to go to the hotel in summer, consider that there is no sandy beach. You can lie down and have a swim directly in front of the hotel, but it's more a concrete boardwalk than a beach.I would recommend the hotel for a trip to the Slovenian coast but I would give it 4 stars rather than 5."
30.06.2010,1,"We had the misfortune to stay at this Hotel as the conference we were attending was held there. On check in, we were advised that we had been upgraded to suite. What we weren't told was that the bed was a waterbed and the lounge area was just big enough to fit a couch and a chair, no television. The bathroom had ants crawling all over the floor, the bath and basin. To give the staff credit, they did move us as soon as we asked for another room and the bed in the new room was much more comfortable. However, anytime we asked for help with anything else, the staff bordered on rude. Even the new room did not come up to a 5 star rating, probably closer to a 2 star.One little tip if you have to stay at this hotel, the lower the floor the bigger the room. Because it is built into the side of the cliff, the higher rooms are much narrower and smaller. Best tip - don't stay there."
7.04.2010,1,"We recently spent 8 days in this hotel with a group. The showers are moldy (and tiny), the single chair in our double room broke when my slender husband sat on it, and the corners of the room had not been vacuumed in months. The carpeted floor had many years of stains. The hair dryer made an incredible amount of noise, but the air coming out was never warm. If you try to hang up clothes, either the whole rod comes crashing down, or the hanger breaks. Beware if you eat in the restaurant -- between our group and another one, 75 people suddenly came down with vomiting and diarrhea. The food varies between acceptable and bad. Food from the previous evening almost always shows up the next day. The staff is exceptionally unpleasant and unhelpful. When the door to the hall where our room was located was blocked, they refused to send anyone to open it, and expected my young daughter, already soaked by a downpour, to stand in the cold and rain for over an hour. (The manager specifically asked us to leave the lobby and wait by the outside door!!!) When the dogs in the next room barked through the night and terrorized our children, they refused to give us different rooms."
20.11.2009,2,"This is the Italian expression for, well, pretentiousnes. The hotel's rooms (at least at storey 9, chosen by us because it's near to the - admittedly very attractive - pool and wellness centre) are small, almost tiny, with awful furniture (cheap, old without quality) and very little storage space for more than a couple of days (nice balcony views, but nothing you wouldn't get at any of the better local hotels, and they exist). Bathrooms are slightly larger but hardly correspond to 5-star standards (small tub, plastic shower curtain - 5-star???). Restaurant staff, by our experience, was friendly, although shrimp (THE SAME shrimp) was served two evenings in a row. (!!) And now for the really bad bit (which will likely interest only part of readers, but whose implications should interest all because it is of importance to all customers in the sense of how the staff reacts): there is a small, water-surrounded island in front of the hotel where, it seems, two young, and very nice-looking cats live (or are confined). I say confined because it seems not easy for them to get out (they did not in a night of torrential rain). They also beg for food if they notice people coming into the hotel (nobody from the hotel feeds them, despite the enormous quantities of food thrown away). Now, in Austria (I'm Austrian), this does not exist - there are lots of free-roaming cats, of course, but not in front in self-styled 5-star hotels (not because they're killed but because people take care of them). If you ask the hotel staff about them, you get a bored, disinterested reply (""well, they should go away, they're not my business."" - BAD idea psychologically speaking, if you want to attract customers with sympathy for animals). The same staff, I may say, did not give our our welcome drink (not that we care but it was included in the package) or advise us that we had a half-hour massage included (I had to request this). It is not necessarily that you get bad service in Slovenia - I must really write a review of good to excellent service we got at Portoroz Hotels Marita and Metropol - but at this hotel they clearly live in a century way gone by ( plus all the arrogance of ""Well, what's the option"", but options there are). There is also a parrakeet imprisoned in a tiny, musty cage in a dark zone without a companion for whoever's entertainment. I'm not an animal nut (yet these things irk me), but again, it reflects on the general atmophere. The hotel is, off-season, filled with conference attendees, but, in season or off, we will not return (unless to feed the cats), and we know more or less all all the better hotels in the area. (Reviews hopefully forthcoming.)"
3.08.2009,5,"We have just returned from 2 weeks staying at the Grand Hotel Bernardin. What a lovely hotel in a great location with picturesque Piran next door. We had a lovely room on the 9th floor with views across to Coatia and Italy. The room was comfortable and very clean, and well stocked with all you need on holiday. The brand new spa with affinity pool and jacuzzi was just along the corridor and we would make use of it before going down to our breakfast. The breakfast was plentiful, lots of choice, hot and cold and very attentive staff who kept the tables clear. The seaside area was well looked after by staff who were attentive to get you towels and loungers as soon as you walked down. My one critisism is that there was a seaside bar but this was not open and this was a shame as the bar that was open was alongside the promenade without any view of the sea. Also there was not any waiter service for drinks, meaning you had to tear yourself away from your lounger to get a drink - no real hardship really!!The area around the hotel was lovely. Piran was a 15 minute walk from the hotel and a delight to explore with lots of nice restaurants and places to sit have a drink and watch the world go by. There are a few shops but not many, certainly it would not appeal to anyone who needs to shop. Also at night it is relatively low key without any loud music bars. Portoroz to the otherside of our hotel was a 25/30 minute walk and much more modern and busy with lots of restaurants and Casinos but without the character of Piran.We found lots to do during our 2 weeks, including walks around the coast and through olive groves on the hills - we picked up a very handy leaflet of Walks around Piran from the Tourist Information. There are boat trips to do and bikes that can be hired plus public transport links to other villages along the coast. All in all a wonderful holiday destination with plenty to do if you want, a good choice of places to eat and drink and beautiful scenery - and of course a lovely hotel to come back to each day."
22.07.2009,4,"Stayed one week with family. Very happy with hotel . The dining hall is spacious and meals were varied and plentiful. Only local beer on offer but both were OK. Service was efficient but waiters are not the most talkative.Room was not particularly luxurious but iwas clean and the view of the Adriatic from the balcony spectacular. Both Italy and Crotia were visible from our 3rd floor balcony.The best part of the hotel is its private beach. Unlike Piran, the beach was not crowded and the beach attendants were there in a flash to help with chairs and parasols.The top floor bar is also recommended - an ideal place to unwind after dinner."
22.07.2009,5,"the hotel is so nice.good service , good fod , beautiful view from the balcony and spa!!!!"
19.07.2009,1,"I travelled to this ""5 star"" hotel with my wife as part of our summer holidays. We stayed one week there and then moved on to Lake Bled for the second week. What a contrast. This hotel on arrival looks to be all you would expect going by the appearance of the outside and also the grand foyer and reception. THATS WHERE IT ENDS, We arrived early afternoon and checked in with a friendly girl at reception. Having done this the Bell boys were nowhere to be seen so getting our luggage to our room was left to ourselves. Having reached the room the key card wouldnt work to let us in. I tried to use the phone on the landing but it didnt work, I made my way to reception and got another programmed. As a seasoned traveller I know this can happen. So down I go again and on entering the room the leg of the table was lying in the middle of the floor. I rang from the room and the elusive bell boy eventually arrived. He said they would fix it, but I insisted on another room as, after all the travelling, the last thing we needed was a workman with a hammer in the bedroom. By the way the room was small well used and 3star standard (on a good day). Reception rang back to let us have the room change and after hauling our own luggage yet again, the room we were given had not been cleaned from the previous guests. At this stage I lost the plot and handed the luggage to the bell boy and informed him when they had it sorted out he would find us at the beach cafe at the hotel which was the only place within the hotel complex to get anything to eat at this time of day 2-30pm. We were fed up thirsty hungry and very very tired. The cafe was joke. After trying to order from the very limited menu and being told they were out of it, i asked what they actually did have and then we could choose rom that. This 5* hotel could only offer one portion of a pitiful and sad looking cheese salad and one Prawn and red sauce sandwich with the edges well dried up. We were told by the waitress that the chef only makes so much and then goes home!!!!! We tried to eat them but to no avail. and just left them. This did not stop them charging us an extortion. This is NOT 5*. After about a half hour or so we had to go looking for our room as nobody had botherd to find us. (there were only 4 other customers at the cafe so they would have had no bother finding us.) At reception yes the cases were back there and we were handed the key to another room and left to sort our own luggage yet again. Only after insisting the bell boy came with us, oh and no he didnt offer tyo move our luggage.The Hotel is dead in the evening, drinks grossly overpriced and staff are a grumpy bunch. We only slept there. I could go on and on. The area is very beautiful and there are lots of places to eat out at a fraction of the price and choice sooooo much better than the hotel..I WILL NEVER BE BACK AGAIN TO THE BERNARDIN HOTEL, We moved on to the Grand Hotel Toplice at Lake Bled, another 5* and what a difference it was FANTASTIC. I will leave a review there too. Sell this as a 3* and it would be nearer the truth.."
9.07.2009,1,"They charged us double sometime but for a few dozens Euro we preffered to enjoy holiday. Very unfriendly personel. They only have 2 kinds of bad beer ( and are very proud of it because it's local) and only local, also very bad wine."
25.10.2008,4,"Stayed at the Grand Bernadin at a conference and was amazed by the location and of course Piran. No wonder it is UNESCO registered, this place is straight out of the postcards. The hotel is a little odd for those of us used to Asian hospitality and service, but the views from the rooms of the Adriatic are amazing and it is a short walk to Piran and if you want, Portoroz with its Casinos. This place does Italian as good as or better than the Italians and any of the restaurants along the water are worth visiting. The seafood is fantastic. It may be a bit hectic in summer, but our stay wil live with us forever. Get on the bus to Piran!"
16.09.2008,4,"We stayed here for 11 nights and were absolutely delighted with the place. Although it is classed as a five star hotel, I do think realistically it is more 4 star by Western standards, but that is in no way meant to be a criticism because the prices are definately not five (or even four) star prices! We were on the third floor, the room was perfectly adequate for our needs, fantastic views over the Adriatic with lovely sunsets every night. Very reasonably priced mini bar, change of towels and linen every couple of days.We only used the restaurant for breakfast, and what a fantastic choice available! Hot and cold buffet, plenty of fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurt, juices and all the different flavours of tea available.The reception desk staff were extremely friendly, polite and professional. It seemed nothing was too much trouble for them.The swimming pool was a joy to be in. Extremely clean and modern, having only opened in May 2008, not olympic size and only 1.5m deep, but it more than served the purpose.The ""private"" beach is just a concrete/part grass strand with steps into the rocky sea, but then again, all along the Slovenian/Croatian/Montenegran coast is more or less the same, this isn't a white sandy location. The hotel is in walking distance of Piran, which is a lovlier town to visit than it's most over-rated, over-priced, over-crowded cousin across the sea Venice."
3.09.2008,2,"We stayed at the Bernardin on the second week of a Slovenian holiday in August. The hotel is well situated with easy access to Piran. The Reception area is about the only 5 star aspect of the hotel. We booked a superior room and ended up on the first floor where every room is dark and denied a view due to trees. The other 88% of rooms appear to have uninterupted sea views. The reception staff were not at all helpful when we asked to change rooms, even less helpful when I asked to change some cash.There is a terrace bar with great views but staffed daily by the most miserable barman I have ever encountered, he put Victor Meldrew in the shade.The restaurant staff were very good, but as the food is a buffet service it soon got cold and if you wanted fish you had to be there within ten minutes of the place opening.The hotels private beach is a concrete affair with public access available at a fee so if you want a sunbed without any cushions you need to enter the battle of the towels before 8am. If you want a beach holiday Slovenia is not for you.This hotel pretends to be something it is not. The area is very touristy but Piran is beautiful and well worth a few days exploration."
31.08.2008,2,"This is not a five star or even a three star hotel in my opinion by Western Standards. We paid 350 Euros for one night for a ""Junior Suite"" which was a regular hotel room with an adjoining room with only a sleeper sofa and a cot. In its heyday (probably when it was still Yugoslavia) this was probably a very good hotel, and it compares favorably to Communist Country hotel's that I have stayed in the 80's. But Slovenia is a member of the E.U. and charges more than E.U prices, for basically what amounts to be a sub-mediocre room, with unextraordinary sea views, in a tacky location. The bed was really squishy too. I even commented to my wife that the Red Roof Inn has better rooms than this place (really). This was very disappointing (we knew better than perhaps some of the other reviewers on the board about what we should expect since we have vacationed multiple times in Croatia (Dalmatia) and the location, people and hotels are incomparable. Sorry Portoroz and Slovenia."
28.08.2008,4,"We have just stayed a week in this lovely hotel with our two children aged 9 and 14. Not many activities for them, but they enjoyed the food and fantastic private beach with the lovely clear waters of the Adriatic - both our kids are great swimmers.The hotel is in a fantastic location - all the rooms have the most fab sea views - you can see Croatia and Italy (and the Alps on a clear day). Rooms are on the small side for a 5* hotel, but are comfortable and clean (showers work well!).We stayed HB and found the food (buffet style) to be very good. Staff are polite and helpful, although their English is not great.Piran is amazing and only a 10 minute walk from hotel (or you can catch the park and ride bus close to the hotel - handy if weather is hot!). Piran is like a smaller version of Sienna.Area is very pretty - great cycle paths and walks. We hired a private speed boat and were taken along the coast - not cheap but WOW - well worth it to see this lovely stretch of coastline.I would recommend this hotel - clean with good food and it's location if fab."
16.07.2008,4,"We stayed in this hotel just for 2 days, for a weekend and actually we chose it following the advice of our friends. First of all the place is really beautiful, with beautiful clean Adriatic sea. The hotel has a good location and is near to the center of a city which you can reach just with 10 min of taxi. The stuff of hotel was also really friendly and helpfull. Our room was on the 9th floor with fantastic seaview. The room was big enough also with spacious balcony. In the wardrobe there were also bathrobes which you could put to go diretly to the beach. S[eaking about breakfast i can also say that it was rich, fresh and tasty: a lot of kinds of cheese, ham, vegetables, fruits, some kinds of pastry, dairy produts...ect.This hotel can be really good for people that are searching relax, there was also a possibility to make different kinds of massages, face cleaning, manicure and pedicure and other treatments at a really good price! Probably the only disadvantage of this hotel is that there is no outdoor swimming pool, there is 1 but that is for children and another thing is that the beach is too much small. Also can be a problem for small children to enter in the sea since the sea is stony and normally there are scales that take you directly inside water. For the rest I can say that i liked so much that hotel and if I'll come back to that place I know which hotel I'll choose. As for me that hotel has a really good combination of price and quality!"
23.07.2007,5,"Stayed at the Bernardin for a week in July, and found Slovenia very charming and quite sophisticated. I imagined it was a bit like a high class holiday in the 50's, with a dash of The Talented Mr Ripley scenery thrown in.I must admit we came through Portoroz by taxi when when we arrived and gave it a miss afterwards, as Piran was a tremendous wee place, and felt Portoroz looked a bit busier and touristy. The Bernardin is about 10 minutes walk from Piran and it's a pleasant walk along the promenade. The hotel itself is mixture of 5 star and 3 star. The rooms are nice enough but relatively basic, but this is balanced by the fantastic unobstructed views from the balconies with the coast of Croatia to the left and Italy to the right. Once all the boats start to-ing and fro-ing at the weekend it really is quite spectacular. We had booked half board and although the food was OK we decide to eat out in Piran for most of the week as the hotel restaurant was inside and a wee bit stuffy although I understand you could have used some of the restaurants at the other hotels in the Bernardin complex at Hotel Histrion like the Barca. Breakfast was ok, with a massive range of buffet food geared more towards other Europeans, of which Italians were by far the more prominent numbers. The Grand Cafe is very grand and has spectacular views. The hotel is very quiet even though it's pretty large, and the private lido-type promenade always seemed to have tons of loungers , so theres no problem getting on and the space is large at the front of the hotel. Even though there was no beach it was very nice and would be safe for kids as the hotel has it's own lifeguards. The Histrion Hotel has a dedicated water park for kids so may be the best option for families, but you had free entry as it was part of the complex. Restaurants are practically all fish or Italian in Piran, and steaks/meat dishes were very much in the minority on the extensive menu's. Chicken is a rarity apparently in Slovenia and lamb non-existent. Turkey and pork are the order of the day when it's not fish. Riva, Pavel 1 and 2 , Adriatic and Three Widows were all excellent.The staff were pleasant and helpful, and I found the Slovenian people overall exceptionally polite and willing to assist.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would pitch the hotel at 4 star quality. I would have no hesitation staying here again, and though the was a conference on whilst we were there didn't find it at all problematic, as it probably meant that the facilities were quiter as the delegates were busy elsewhere."
14.07.2007,4,"We have just spent 3 days in Grand Hotel Bernardin in Portoroz. The architecture of the hotel is great, hotel is clean, the beach is great, but the rooms are rather small for a 5* hotel. GH Bernardin is located in a Hoteli Bernardin complex just between Portoroz and Piran. The complex has an excellent restaurant called Barka, which serve excellent mediterranean food for decent prices."
10.07.2007,4,"We were here primarily for a conference and this seems to be where the hotel has positioned itself. This could be a problem for regular private guests as the lifts get clogged frequently as the conference facilities are split between the ground and 11th floors. Also, when we were there, another meeting was in progress and we were blocked from using hotel walkways and stairs by burly security men who made us feel quite unwelcome.The location is excellent and the sea views from the rooms outstanding. The ocean front area for sunbathing is pleasant, but there is the usual jockeying for location by reserving with towels quite early in the morning. The Hotel makes no attempt to sell drinks or provide any service at the sunbathing area which I found strange for a 5* hotel - they are missing a lot of sales, and causing inconvenience. There is a snack bar but the staff seemed very overworked and no waiting service is provided.The room was clean and modern - bathroom rather small. The worst part was the breakfast - the bacon had to be the worst I have ever seen - microwaved fat! and no one to cook eggs - again poor for a 5* hotel.I thought the staff were generally excellent, helpful and friendly. on balance, thumbs up, but please improve the shoddy breakfast performance. Would I go again as a conference delegate, YES. Would I go for a private holiday, probably NO.(Too many conference attendees, badged and clutching laptops!!)."
2.03.2015,5,"This time we just went there to have a coffe on the terrace of this hotel. This is the most beautifull terrace at the Slovenian cost. With a fantastic view. You can just seat there in peace and enjoy the view.Service is also great, very nice and kind waitress, good coffee.I really like coming back every time I can. And I cannot wait the next time.My favorite place."
28.01.2015,5,"excellent hotel in portorose,we stayed there in may,was a fantastic week end.the first thing i liked was the fantastic view on the sea.room very big and clean,staff was very helpfull .there is also a big casino downside.5 stars."
7.01.2015,4,"Hotel is located at the northern tip of Portorož (a bit far from centre) and has a stunning view, specialy if you are lucky enough to get upper floor room.Funny thing with this hotel is that reception - ""ground floor"" is actually on the top of hotel. it is because hotel itself is on the hill, and goes all the way down to the sea level. I stayed in hotel in November, and it was quite nice stay overall. Hotel staff are very easygoing and kind, but professional in the same time, food is good and breakfast choice was ok.Room equipment and whole feeling was not up to 5* standards (rather old rooms that would need refurbishment in following days, old small tv with not so much tv channels,...), i had hmmmm... somewhat 80s feeling inside. But, maybe it's just my point of view. Wifi in my room didnt work, in the lobby it was ok. Lobby is very large, seems too big in fact. Bar is good with good atmosphere, i didn't have the chance to try out the pool, which was on level 9.All in all, when you compare pros and cons, its a good hotel with affordable price."
10.12.2014,5,"I stayed in this hotel 2 nights during end of May '14. wonderful location, breathtaking view. reception in the top and the floors go down to the beach. Excellent service, rooms are small but clean. One must visit in a life time."
30.10.2014,4,Hotel is in nice place and most of the things are OK. Maybee rating of the hotel sets expectations of more that you will receive. Food is fair and staff also in similar level. management should do something more to raise service up where should belong.
23.10.2014,4,"This is one of the finest hotels in slovenian coast...it is placed on the clif and you arrive at the top floors and rooms are below the Reception. The view is magnificent, the pool is small, cosy but just for max 20 people. One of the minuses are the rooms, which are not big enough for 5*, the toilet is nice but not enough for 5*, the beach is also not so good, not even close to beach that 5* hotel should have..."
19.10.2014,3,"I spend there three night son December due to a Congress and everything looked as if the hotel was only open for our group, which was not as big as the hotel. So I dela a little bit out of place there. It might be great in the summer... Price was too expansiva for what we got."
8.10.2014,4,We were here on Our Tour of Venice. Great place on Seashore. A perfect weekend retreat and also a pivotal place for Slovenia tour. Great Sunset and sunrise moods around. Piran tour is a moening walk and evening walk tour with enjoyable Sunset hues.Rooms were well appointed staffsstaffs were very warm and particular. Foods were lipsmacking. We enjoyed Our stay in a great note. Every evenings were great.
1.10.2014,3,"It would get a higher rating if it didn't advertise itself as a 5 star property and didn't charge 5 star prices. Everyone is very efficient and friendly, but things are rather worn. The carpet in our room had been well worn. Also, the gym (or rather what they claim is a gym) is a small forgotten space with some communist era machines. Skip. Also, if you come during a conference, expect long waits for one of only three elevators.Don't expect much space in the rooms. Our Jr. Suite cabin for our cruise was larger with a bigger bathroom and a walk-in closet. This room had no such thing. At least it had a mini-fridge. Only one person at a time in the bathroom.The best thing about the property is the view. And since you are paying for it, get one as high as possible. 9th is the top floor for rooms. Breakfast is on the 10th. Lobby is on the 11th.Tip: The soap in the bathroom is vegetable soap and disintegrates quickly. Ask for extra."
1.10.2014,4,"View is excellent, all rooms are ocean view. All staffs are courteous, professional and effective. Prompt services were provided.Convention center is also new and beautiful. Only problem was elevator-as only 2 available for guests, so too crowded and busy when those meetings at convention center started/end.Business lunches were fairly priced and quality of food was good.I believe most of guests were seniors. You can walk or take a bus to Piran, old town at the tip?of peninsula."
4.08.2014,3,"This hotel has clearly been refurbished recently to a good standard. The rooms are a decent size and clean, though the pillows are rubbish.The buffet dinner had a good selection of dishes for a main course, starters were limited to soup or salad and dessert was very limited.The hotel has an indoor pool with an outside area with very hard plastic sun-loungers (no cushions on top). There is an outdoor pool across the road but you have to pay to use the sun-loungers.It was strange that ALL the staff seemed very miserable, we didn't see a single smile in the 3 days we were there"
31.07.2014,3,"Located on the strip about a 10 minute walk from the bus stop with a salt water indoor pool plus a separate children's pool, a terrace for drinks and a water front area. The hotel has standard rooms; mine on the first floor opened up to a large shared patio area with no seating. Front desk is helpful. The hotel/waterfront area contains amusement games/parks for kids and lots of restaurants, including 2 Mexican choices; a supermarket is located directly across the street and a casino 200 meters down the road. The tourist area is worn but lively but unfortunately had a sewerish smell in the evening."
28.07.2014,3,"Hotel has big entrance not hard to miss. It has spatious lobby that opens to dining room (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Its dining room is smaller and less inviting than lobby with strange overlook of stairs that make no sense, could have terasse. To the left there is standard carpet floor to the rooms. Rooms are standard and someone complained with outdated decor, that depends on taste. It is just basic, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast included in one night stay has some variety. But could be a bit better with choices. As one reviewer put it boring. For example: Slovenians have many sorts of bread and they could offer those instead of plain precut loaf. Could have trays of some sort, it is a big room and you have to visit displayed food many times to serve yourself a breakfast. One night for two people costs ~130€, but parking is not included. 5€ for one day with 10€ deposit."
29.05.2014,5,"We were in hotel for 6 days, room was comfortable and clean and our 2 kids (1 and 3 years) had lots of fun in playroom. Food was very good, a lot to choose from. Also a good location, everything at the hand. We sure gonna visit it again and we recommend this hotel for families."
25.05.2014,3,"This hotel has an odd""flow"". From the huge reception that houses efficient, friendly staff you can go into the dinning room or pass into the very plastic bar and from here pass to the lifts.Rooms are adequate and clean although the decor is fishy and dated. Shower room was big enough to swing your towel and again clean.My room overlooked the main road and was noisy at night especially when the clubs close. The balcony got sun for part of the day but was so noisy I tended to go to the beach area.The dinning room was always busy and the buffet area wa snort designed for easy access and choice of food. A big plus point - the food was hot unlike many hotels that I have used.The pool are was okay but the staff seems unfriendly and the gardens difficult to access."
25.05.2014,4,We stayed for 3 nights with an infant. The room was nice and clean. Staff was friendly and very helpfull. The pool was nice and not crowded. For a short break just the right place together with the other possibilities that Portoroz offers.
15.05.2014,4,"I stayed here as part of a small group of fellow single travellers. I had a comfortable room on the 3rd floor overlooking the indoor pool and grassed area to the road, with a nice balcony. There was very little traffic noise. No mini bar in the room although there was a safe. The bathroom was very small as was the shower but everything was spotlessly clean. Sleep quality was not great as the pillows were very hard. The hotel has very smart public areas but the bar closes at 10pm although there was a happy hour which was much appreciated. Staff on the whole were friendly and efficient and most spoke good English. The food was okay, there was plenty of it, but very much the same each night and morning and with no choice of dessert except for cake each night."
7.05.2014,3,"Room was small, clean with no balcony and no fridge.Breakfast was good. I also had self service dinner which was not so good.Wifi was free only at reception. Free parking was infront of the hotel, but it was full so I had to park in the garage which was not free."
24.02.2014,4,"We used the hotel as our base during the 3 day vacation.It's located at the edge of Portorož yet still within walking distance to the centre. The free parking spaces in front of the hotel are really limited so we used the garage at reasonable 5€/day. The nearby beach is virtually nonexistend, which wasn't a problem since it was wintertime. We used the saltwater indoor pool which had plenty of lockers and sunbeds, a children's pool and a whirlpool. We didn't use the adjoining spa because all the treatments were reserved - so book ahead for the weekend! We did however use the children's playroom, which is big enough, light and stacked ceiling-high with toys. The highlight was the dinosaur-shaped climbing wall for the lil' ones. There also seems to be a kids animation programme going on at weekends, which we didn't partake. The buffet breakfast and dinner were more than O.K. considering the 3 star hotel rating; our only complaint (besides the proverbial bad coffee in hotel breakfast rooms) is that the egg-chef seems to sleep-in too often. There is a hotel bar for the coffee afficionados, however; unfortunatelly the bar was empty and overlit which killed the ""bar-mood"" a bit. The room was spacious enough for a family of four, with good firm beds and just the right amount of storage space. There's no mini bar, but we didn't miss it at all. What we did miss was at least a queen-sized bed instead of two single beds loosely pushed together.All the staff we dealt with were extremely proffesional and kind.All in all the hotel performed solid in all areas and seemed like a good value choice - we'll probably return."
8.12.2013,4,"We were staying for 10 days. Room was clean and nice. Brekfast all time were the same and very poor, we had hb, so and superrs was bad. But anyway, very good location, near to beach, pleasant stuff. I would go next time to this hotel. Near the bus station, and clubs."
26.10.2013,4,"I stayed here for 2 weeks in September 2013 for a sports event and overall the hotel was excellent for my needs. It is clean and pleasant and the breakfast is pretty good. While it in not cheap price-wise it compares quite well with the nearby competition. Location is good - across the road are a range of shops, bakery, restaurants and laundry - the pizza joint is good and the fish restaurant is very good and good value for the quality of fish. Hotel staff were generally helpful and front desk staff (I should single out Myriam here) were especially helpful. Only bad staff moment was being asked to vacate breakfast table very shortly after official finish time. It is worth the 2 euros per day to get wifi in your room though wifi in the lobby is fairly decent. I didn't use the pool because sea swimming was so pleasant and the facilities for same very good - a nice place for a holiday overall..."
18.09.2013,4,"I stayed at hotel during a conference held in the same complex. Despite the 3 stars I have to say hotel offers comfortable stay with some nice goodies. The breakfast is quite good and offers decant amount of distinct dishes for the price. Rooms are clean and tidy, but some have a smell of drain from the bathroom.Staying includes indoor and outdoor pool. The hotel is connected with its pricier 5 star brother which offers spa and other wellness and casino. It is situated close to the coast. I did not like that you have to pay additional 2€ per day for wireless connection but it is at least decant price. Hotel also offers a 5€ per day parking in their garage which is cheap for the spot.They have good offers after the high season which makes it even better."
30.08.2013,4,"Travelled from the UK and booked direct with the hotel rather than through UK Travel agent. This made for some great savings. Bearing in mind rated 3* we cannot fault the facilities. Family room 2 Adults and 2 children very clean, spacious and quiet.Comfortable at night with AC in the room. Good base just out of Portoroz in Lucija easy walk into the centre and managed the longer walk to Piran along the promenade ( 1 hr ) although buses run every 15 mins direct from the hotel. We hired a car from the airport and very easy access into Croatia ( 5 minutes up the road by car from the hotel) - so well located if you are planning to go further a field. We booked on Half board basis as little difference in the price between HB and BB- food buffet style every night - informal dining and again no complaints again we considered good value. Staff very friendly and accommodating."
19.08.2013,3,"Hotel was clean and functional but very expensive for what it was. No wifi in the rooms but available in the bar. My biggest gripe would be how unhappy everyone appeared to be. In 5 days I only met one employee at the hotel who had a cheerful disposition and friendly smile. The rest looked at you as if you were just an inconvenience that had to be tolerated for a limited period and spoke to you as though they had broken glass in their mouths that might cause them serious injury if they smiled. They were unwelcoming and well trained in the art of avoiding eye contact. Shame really, I expected them to be more friendly in Slovenia for some reason, perhaps a misplaced perception."
14.08.2013,3,"We spent a family vacation in this Hotel. Two adults and two children cramped in a double room, which was called a ""family room"". Kids had to sleep on two mattresses on the floor and the double bed was clearly hanging in. No fridge in the room. Staff is very helpful and kind. AC was hardly working with temp up to the 90's. WLan was only available in public areas. Breakfast is not a hit, but dinner buffet is usually tasty and affordable - childrens are free. Important to know: no sand beach in town! During high season the nights turn into day...party everywhere..."
12.08.2013,4,"We found this to be a medium quality hotel in a very good position - just over the road from the sea. The hotel has its own indoor pool and free use of the large shared outdoor pool across the road. However, if you want to use a sun lounger or an umbrella you will have to pay 7 Euros for each item ie. 2 loungers and 1 umbrella = 21 Euros for however long you want to stay in one day. A better option is to use the hotel pool which is inside, but connected to an outside area with grass and decking - where the sun loungers and umbrellas are free. No towels are provided, even at the hotel's own pool - so take you own!The rooms at the front and sides of the hotel are far superior to those at the back - and the back rooms look out on to a large concrete wall!"
8.08.2013,5,"I would like to say that we just experienced a very relaxing holiday in Hotel Lucija. My boys (4 and 6) loved the swimming pools, teh beach, the hotel garden and the large appartment terrace for all their toys ;) Also the staff and other guest were nice and friendly. We will surely return next year."
15.07.2013,4,"The location of the hotel is very good. Only 3-5minutes to the beads, The hotelstaff is very friendly and helpfull. The indoor swimmingpool with warm seawater is good. Breakfast is quite normal and fine. Very clean and good aircooling in the rooms. Across the street is also very good swimmingpoll and sunbade garden wich belong to the hotel"
9.06.2013,3,"I spent a couple of nights here, the hotel is fine but maybe too expansive for what he can offer... the internet wifi is free only in the hall, even if to get a good signal you have to sit in the bar. For the rooms only a cable connection is available.It is possible to park your car in the garage for 10 euro per day and you can reach the Metropol casino just walking.I found the woman at the reception quite rude and not friendly at all... the guy instead was more gentle and always ready to help us even without being asked."
20.10.2012,5,"Me and my friend had 2 great weeks in this hotel at the end of June'12. This hotel has the best location among others in Metropol hotel group in Portorozh. It's far from the beach, you should cross the road and walk right about 2 minutes. There is a few sand on the beach. Only grass and concrete slab, so keep it in mind. 10 minutes to the left from the hotel - a big supermarket. You can buy pizza and tasty cakes just behind the hotel, across the road. A wonderful bar Allaya is about 5 minutes from the hotel with a great sea view! Most necessary to visit! :)There is a good breakfast and dinner in the hotel. Nice bar with TV on th 1-st floor. Free wi-fi is near reception and a bar zone. No Internet in the rooms, but there is a balcony and good view) There is a nice town Piran about 1 hour go on foot or just 15 minutes by bus from Portorozh. It's better to use a bus because of hard long walking in the heat ;) Have a nice holiday in Slovenia and enjoy sunny Portorozh!"
20.08.2012,4,"I spent five days in the hotel Lucija two years ago. We had a nice, clean room vit a balcony and AC. We were there in time of the Portorož tenis turnir so there was a lot of people. I had a bad experience in reception when I wanted to stay few more days and one employe made me an reservation and than anather one canceled my reservation because he had friends comming from Italy and he gave us a filling that they were more important than Slovenian guests (they had no reservation).The service vas in generaly good. The food was also veery tasty prepared. The beach is across the streat so is the hotel pool. The pool is very poor."
12.08.2012,4,"We (me, my husband and two children aged 7 and 3) stayed at the Lucija for 5 nights and we loved it! We had a famly room which was spacious and although it didn't have a balcony we had a large french door, plus the room was airconditioned.The hotel is in a great location on the sea front in Portoroz, close to all the restaurants, shops and oter attractions. We had free use of the outdoor pool next to the beach with ou hotel pass, plus the indoor pool at the hotel which was lovely too.We stayed on a B&B basis and the breakfasts were great, loads to eat and plenty of spaces to sit. We ate out at various restaurants along the Obala Road and enjoyed all our meals.The hotel has secure parking for €5 per day which is much chepear than leaving the car in the road.Overall I would not hesitate to recommend the Lucija to other families looking for somewhere to stay in Portoroz."
6.08.2012,4,"We had one night here and we enjoyed it. Hotel rooms was clean and large. Portoroz is nice city, but they dont have sand beach. Not a good location for spending hole week, but i liked it. If you need hotel for good price, go there."
6.08.2012,5,"In 14 years of traveling in a wheelchair, visiting over more than 50 hotels, I can tell you the Hotel Lucija has the best equiped handicap room for disableds. They have 2 rooms, one for 2 persons and one for 4 persons. Both have enough space to maneuver for your wheelchair and equipment, a wide bathroom with no obstacles. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpfull. The hotel is located in the middle of Portoroz, so you do not need any transport to visit restaurants and other activities. Next year I will come back."
1.08.2012,4,"We only had one night here and enjoyed the short time we were here. Everything was clean, organized and of a high standard. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was on the ground floor and so we had a patio onto the grass at the front - even so, it was quite private and it was nice sitting outside and enjoying the quietness; even with a major road very close.The breakfast was good in the morning - but we did not sample the restaurant for dinner; we chose an excellent pizzeria that was close by. Overall a very nice experience."
25.07.2012,4,"Walked in from the street and got a room with help of the helpful reception.Room: Large room that felt new. Bathroom was clean with good interior.Pool: You have access to the beach pool area with salt water pools, as well as the smaller pool on the premises.Breakfast: Large buffet with most things you may wish.Free WiFi in the reception area."
26.06.2012,3,"We've just had a week in this hotel. Whilst it was clean and the staff were generally friendly and helpful, like many modern hotels, it lacks any charm or atmosphere. We found the self service menus far too repetitive and, judging by the regularly sized portions of meat etc., much had obviously been pre-processed. Much of the ""hot"" food should have been hotter.On each table was a card asking guests NOT to take food out of the restaurant for consumption elsewhere. Our observations showed that this was being blatantly ignored.We had asked for a room with a balcony and a sea view. Whilst the balcony was ample the only view was of a parade of shops."
20.06.2012,4,"Just got back from short break at Hotel Lucija Portoroz. As always I traveled with my girlfriend, and we're both plesently surprised with this hotel. Hotel is ranked as 3 star, so we didn't expect too much, but we're wrong. Hotel is refurbished, staff is very friendly, rooms are clean and nicely equipped. The only downside in my opinion is lack of choice at dinner. (bare in mind that this is my opinion).Hotel has interior pool with heated salt water, but you can visit for free open pool just across the road. (sunbeds and umbrella at this pool are payebale - 15€ for 2 sunbeds and umbrella). Near hotel are parking garage (guests have discount, so you pay about 5€ per day), shops, restaurants..Places worth your visit: - Piran (lovely port city, about 10 minutes drive)- Izola (about 15 minutes drive)summary: Lovely hotel with great location, cheap, free internet in rooms (not Wi-fi - this is available only in reception and hotel bar), freindly staff"
4.06.2012,3,"It is perhaps ufair to rate this hotel as average. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. The food was definitely average, though I did like the fact that it was a buffet and not a fixed menu. We had no problems with the food running out, as it was the off season (May).Our room had a balcony and we were situated over the main street. On the weekend we arrived we had loud techno music from across the street and the traffic noise was a nuisance."
14.05.2011,4,"Excellent choice especially for the families with young children. It is not so expensive so it offers good value, in terms of facilities, position and services for the hotel rate. The position is great, situated on the seaside next to the walking area (lungo mare). In front of the hotel is one of the best (and our favorite one) sea food restaurants (Trattoria del pescatore Santa Lucia). We stayed in standard room without balcony (which is the only one disadvantage). The cleaning standards are high. Well furnished rooms and the rest of hotel, modern and simple style. Swimming pools with sea water are very nice, clean and warm including jacuzzi. The breakfast is good, fresh and wide choice (except juice which is awfull). There is baby/children playing room with organized activities for the kids. There are also organized tours by the hotel which are payed extra. Parking is not free of charge, costs 9 EUR per day. Internet connection is limited - it is free of charge and available in the lobby and some rooms (we had difficulty to connect because there were obviously too many users). Its recommendable to get the room with balcony/terrace."
4.08.2014,3,"This hotel has clearly been refurbished recently to a good standard. The rooms are a decent size and clean, though the pillows are rubbish.The buffet dinner had a good selection of dishes for a main course, starters were limited to soup or salad and dessert was very limited.The hotel has an indoor pool with an outside area with very hard plastic sun-loungers (no cushions on top). There is an outdoor pool across the road but you have to pay to use the sun-loungers.It was strange that ALL the staff seemed very miserable, we didn't see a single smile in the 3 days we were there"
31.07.2014,3,"Located on the strip about a 10 minute walk from the bus stop with a salt water indoor pool plus a separate children's pool, a terrace for drinks and a water front area. The hotel has standard rooms; mine on the first floor opened up to a large shared patio area with no seating. Front desk is helpful. The hotel/waterfront area contains amusement games/parks for kids and lots of restaurants, including 2 Mexican choices; a supermarket is located directly across the street and a casino 200 meters down the road. The tourist area is worn but lively but unfortunately had a sewerish smell in the evening."
28.07.2014,3,"Hotel has big entrance not hard to miss. It has spatious lobby that opens to dining room (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Its dining room is smaller and less inviting than lobby with strange overlook of stairs that make no sense, could have terasse. To the left there is standard carpet floor to the rooms. Rooms are standard and someone complained with outdated decor, that depends on taste. It is just basic, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast included in one night stay has some variety. But could be a bit better with choices. As one reviewer put it boring. For example: Slovenians have many sorts of bread and they could offer those instead of plain precut loaf. Could have trays of some sort, it is a big room and you have to visit displayed food many times to serve yourself a breakfast. One night for two people costs ~130€, but parking is not included. 5€ for one day with 10€ deposit."
29.05.2014,5,"We were in hotel for 6 days, room was comfortable and clean and our 2 kids (1 and 3 years) had lots of fun in playroom. Food was very good, a lot to choose from. Also a good location, everything at the hand. We sure gonna visit it again and we recommend this hotel for families."
25.05.2014,3,"This hotel has an odd""flow"". From the huge reception that houses efficient, friendly staff you can go into the dinning room or pass into the very plastic bar and from here pass to the lifts.Rooms are adequate and clean although the decor is fishy and dated. Shower room was big enough to swing your towel and again clean.My room overlooked the main road and was noisy at night especially when the clubs close. The balcony got sun for part of the day but was so noisy I tended to go to the beach area.The dinning room was always busy and the buffet area wa snort designed for easy access and choice of food. A big plus point - the food was hot unlike many hotels that I have used.The pool are was okay but the staff seems unfriendly and the gardens difficult to access."
25.05.2014,4,We stayed for 3 nights with an infant. The room was nice and clean. Staff was friendly and very helpfull. The pool was nice and not crowded. For a short break just the right place together with the other possibilities that Portoroz offers.
15.05.2014,4,"I stayed here as part of a small group of fellow single travellers. I had a comfortable room on the 3rd floor overlooking the indoor pool and grassed area to the road, with a nice balcony. There was very little traffic noise. No mini bar in the room although there was a safe. The bathroom was very small as was the shower but everything was spotlessly clean. Sleep quality was not great as the pillows were very hard. The hotel has very smart public areas but the bar closes at 10pm although there was a happy hour which was much appreciated. Staff on the whole were friendly and efficient and most spoke good English. The food was okay, there was plenty of it, but very much the same each night and morning and with no choice of dessert except for cake each night."
7.05.2014,3,"Room was small, clean with no balcony and no fridge.Breakfast was good. I also had self service dinner which was not so good.Wifi was free only at reception. Free parking was infront of the hotel, but it was full so I had to park in the garage which was not free."
24.02.2014,4,"We used the hotel as our base during the 3 day vacation.It's located at the edge of Portorož yet still within walking distance to the centre. The free parking spaces in front of the hotel are really limited so we used the garage at reasonable 5€/day. The nearby beach is virtually nonexistend, which wasn't a problem since it was wintertime. We used the saltwater indoor pool which had plenty of lockers and sunbeds, a children's pool and a whirlpool. We didn't use the adjoining spa because all the treatments were reserved - so book ahead for the weekend! We did however use the children's playroom, which is big enough, light and stacked ceiling-high with toys. The highlight was the dinosaur-shaped climbing wall for the lil' ones. There also seems to be a kids animation programme going on at weekends, which we didn't partake. The buffet breakfast and dinner were more than O.K. considering the 3 star hotel rating; our only complaint (besides the proverbial bad coffee in hotel breakfast rooms) is that the egg-chef seems to sleep-in too often. There is a hotel bar for the coffee afficionados, however; unfortunatelly the bar was empty and overlit which killed the ""bar-mood"" a bit. The room was spacious enough for a family of four, with good firm beds and just the right amount of storage space. There's no mini bar, but we didn't miss it at all. What we did miss was at least a queen-sized bed instead of two single beds loosely pushed together.All the staff we dealt with were extremely proffesional and kind.All in all the hotel performed solid in all areas and seemed like a good value choice - we'll probably return."
8.12.2013,4,"We were staying for 10 days. Room was clean and nice. Brekfast all time were the same and very poor, we had hb, so and superrs was bad. But anyway, very good location, near to beach, pleasant stuff. I would go next time to this hotel. Near the bus station, and clubs."
7.03.2015,2,"You still feel - and see the days of socialism in this hotel. The breakfast is poor, the hot food (at breakfast) is lukewarm. Spa: They charge extra for bathrobes. Towels for the pool area cost € 4,00 per piece. Pool area has the socialist charm of the 60s, the plastic chairs are so close to each other that you cannot pass between. The buffet of the spa is void of any food. Wellness area: 5 minutes walk along the main road was closed for repair without giving notice to hotel customers.Room 839: Next to the elevator and whenever a lift arrived you heard the loud ""ping"" of its arrival. Room was very small, the bathroom the same and the toilette paper had the feel of newspaper, an other clear indicator that the hotel tries to safe money... on its guests. - We announced the night before departure that we would be leaving just before 7 am and we were promised coffee to go. Well, the door to the dining room was locked and the cleaning lady outside just pointed at her watch. Conclusion: Never again a so-called Life Class hotel!"
2.03.2015,3,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel. We have chosen it because of a pool as the swimming helps our sun to recover after injury.We have a nice time although the hotel is nothing special for 4* hotel.Room was big enough although very basic.The bed for the son made out of sofa took quite a place. It was very hard and with a big frame. Not nice. Our beds were OK and comfortable. Lights were very poor and only on the wall above beds and the table. I couldn't read in the evening. Also the wardrobe is too small. I don't imagine how a family can spend a week or two holidays here. Where to put all clothes? But room was clean and without any comments. A balcony was big with a table and 2 chairs. But if we would stay longer on holidays we would choose the room with a sea view as this time we look directly to the backyaerd and to the other hotel and it was not a nice view. But we know this when booking and this didn't matter this time.The receptionists were kind but somehow anemic. Without smile and like robots. I haven't got a good feeling for the first time. But they kindly helped our son with a phone when he had a problem and I can just say thank you.We had some drinks and coffe at the hotel bar at the reception. It is a nice bar and a man who served us in the evening was very proffesional and kind as I thinh the waiter must be.The staff at the restaurant was also very nice and enthusiastic with a smile on the face what I missed at the reception.Although the food was good we missed more meat for a dinner - like a steak or chicken or something. To be honest there was the meat but mostly in sauces.A breakfast was good but eggs were not fried enough. This is the only bad thing.We loved the swimming pool - bright and clean and not crowded. However we noticed some food on the floor (although it is forbiden to eat at the swimming pool - people really don't obey the rules) and there were a lot of ants arround. But they cleaned it when I told them. The pool bar is only opened from 11.00 on (a little too late for us as we were early). Nice bar but the coffee was really bad. Nevertheless we enjoyed swimming.We didn't use the massage in WAI TAI center - what a pitty. I was there once before and it was great.But in all we had a good relaxing time and this is what we came for.Portorož itself is more crowded in the summer. In this time of the year it is boring. Many people were out during the day as it was really nice weather, but in the evening streets were empty. More people during the weekend. But it was great to walk along the beach.I recommend this hotel and all others in Life class hotel chain if you like wellnes, but I would not go here for holidays in the summer."
15.02.2015,5,"We spent only one night and two days unfortunately. The staff is really nice and profesional. They have wonderful wellness offer, due to Valentinas day WaiTai was completely sold out, make sure you order in advance for wellness activities. They offered us late check out - till 6pm in the afternoon. Dinner and breakfast were both excellent with wide offer. We are coming back."
10.12.2014,4,"We stayed mid tour 15/9 to 18/9/2014. We had requested an upgrade on booking to sea view with balcony, only to find we had a junior suite with an extra lounge/TV room and 2 good sized balconies overlooking the Portoroz Bay and marina with beautiful views. Impressed with the aircon, which worked perfectly. The staff were very friendly and courteous and a short walk - took us along the seafront to the town with seafront cafes and the nearby pier was a perfect point to capture stunning sunsets that can't be seen from the hotel balcony. Night view across the bay was lovely but you are away from the town centre, not a problem for us, as we were close to the pier to catch a tour round the bay to Piran (within easy bus distance). Breakfast was good and evening meals were reasonable,"
11.11.2014,4,"You could say 4 stars exactly. Breakfast and dinner very very tasty. Good variety of food. Drinks at dinner are for supplement - thats the only down point.Room: for triple room very small , not much place to walk around the room. Balcony also not so big. Anyway the room was very clean.Wellness -quite busy , but overall everything ok.Parking: a bit difficult to find free space. You have parking lots behind hotel. But its uphill and difficult to walk with all suitcases.Service: nothing to add. All are very helpfull and smiling :) Specialy staff in restaurant ,which is nice to see."
20.10.2014,4,"The hotel is nice. Location, rooms, especially the rooms overlooking the sea. It's clean, staff is generally speaking friendly and accommodating.I've been coming to LifeClass resorts for quite some time and have tried out most of the hotels withing the hotel range. I also use other services of the hotels, such as the Wai Thai wellness center inside Riviera hotel.The experience with Wai Thai during my last visit was far below average. Not the massage itself, but the way the staff of the center as well as of the hotel treated me because of a misunderstanding on the price of the massage.I booked thru the phone. The reservation centre confirmed the price of 39 euro per massage I wanted so I booked another one for the following day. When checking out and when I wanted to pay, to my surprise the price of a single massage was 57 euro.The hotel receptionist said she or the hotel didn't have anything to do with that so I should go and speak to the massage centre. I did. The blond receptionist was rude and said the prices are clearly listed on their price list. Something I didn't check, because I trusted the reservation centre. I freaked out primarily of their bluntness and refused to pay the full price.Went back to the hotel and after a bit of haggling, which I found completely out of place decided to go to their swimming pool so they could arrange it between themselves.One thing is for certain ... After consecutive poor experience with Wai Thai center I won't be coming back. Ever. I've had it this time.What I can't understand is that they blamed each other for this and were sending me back and forth and the hotel claiming they didn't have to do anything to do with it."
25.09.2014,4,"We have stayed in the hotel Riviera three nights in spring for the rate of 54 euro per person per night (B&B plan, room #6503, sea view). It was the first hotel, where I have encountered this billing practice. Usually, it is per room per night. Anyway, you have to add here 6 euro for the hire of each bathrobe.The location is second to none in Portoroz with the promenade and the beach just across the road. It is very convenient that they have a large parking at the back of the hotel, which was free of charge. Because of this open parking lot, I would strongly recommend to take rooms with sea view. Do not expect all of them to have balconies, as ours didn't have it.The room itself was very clean, but smallish and quite basic for a four-star hotel. The bathroom was extremely uncomfortable with the toilet and shower cabin much too close together. Moreover there was a poor choice of TV channels and a paid Wi-Fi! Despite all that, the price was quite reasonable, so for short stays it is probably acceptable to put up with certain inconveniences. The breakfast was fairly good, as well as the buffet dinner we decided to have one night in the main restaurant, especially considering the price paid for it. The restaurant staff was very friendly and helpful.To sum it up - a perfect location, good combination of price and quality (at least in low season), but definitely not a 4 star superior hotel."
1.09.2014,5,"This is my tenth year that I have been in Portoroz, mainly in Hotel Riviera. Great accommodation, excellent food, the seaside is 50 meters away, surrounded by cafe bars and restaurants. If you plan to come with family or not you will not be mistaken. Its a perfect holiday place."
11.08.2014,5,"This was our first trip to Hotel Riviera in Portoroz, Slovenia. Lovely hotel and lovely resort. So clean and nice staff.Excellent value for money .Good to be able to visit sister hotels with superb indoor pools.at the Lifeclass Spa.all within walking distance. All free for guestsGreat choice at breakfast and dinner. Easy walk to bars at night..We had a sea view room which I would recommendLovely seafront private area just over the road. Quality. .Have to pay for loungers howeverPiran is a must see, just a short bus ride away and we also managed a day trip to Lake Bled and a nice day out to Trieste In Italy"
29.07.2014,4,"I stayed in the hotel while travelling for business in July 2014. It was an excellent choice! I was amazed by the Lifeclass Spa offer and high end service provided. Another thing that I loved was the breakfast, the offer is vast and cooks are preparing eggs, pancakes, etc. in the breakfast room, produce is local.Staff was friendly and polite. Hotel is very big so even in the busy summer season I did not have the impression it was overcrowded. I will return to this hotel again."
19.07.2014,4,"We stayed at the Hotel Riviera for four nights and loved our time there. Its location is ideal, right on the main promenade and across the street from the beach. We were in a family room with 2 queen sized beds and found the room to have adequate space. Everything was very clean and the beds were quite comfortable. We stayed on the 7th floor and had a spectacular view from the balcony. The restaurant was lovely but the food got boring after a couple of days, especially the breakfast. Overall, the quality of food was good but not great. The beach area was nice with lounge chairs and umbrellas, and I agree with other reviewers that it is a little outrageous for them to charge 6 Euros per chair especially if you only wanted to be at the beach for a couple of hours. The pool complex was fantastic. We had one day of rain and appreciated the indoor pools... the water was warm and my kids loved the different jets and waterfalls. Also, the fitness room was better than average for a hotel like this. While Wi-fi was free, it was not the strongest and so could get frustrating because we were often disconnected. Overall, however, we very much enjoyed our stay at Hotel Riviera and would definitely recommend it to others."
14.07.2014,5,"Just returned from a weeks stay at the Riviera,the hotel is situated right on the promenade with good flat walks left or right.We were on the 4th floor with great views of the sea our room was adequate with ample storage space,free safe and very comfortable beds and pillows we arrived late but we found in our room a very good selection of food had been left for us too much in fact.The staff were excellent all around the hotel.We would recommend the lido bar 3 minutes walk left of the hotel opposite the Palace Hotel as very good value,with amazing hosts and who give free nibbles including ham and melon,grapes,strawberries,little pasta pots,if you drink wine the best value in portaroz."
7.07.2014,4,"We have stayed in the Hotel Slovenija for seven days with our toddler. We have payed 5 Euros per day for the 'kinder bed' for our kid, which is a reasonable price (35 Euros for seven days). The Sea View from our room was gorgeous. The room was spacious and clean. We did not use the mini bar, even though there was one in the room. We had clean towels every day. The hotel is in the center of Portoroz and the beach is right across the street. Portoroz is a lovely place to stay. There was a repairing done on the pool so we did not use it, but the weather was great so we were on the beach with our kid every day. If you want to use the Spa, you need to make a booking at the reception. Te breakfast buffet was various and the stuff was professional and kind. Overall we had a nice and relaxing vacation for a reasonable price and we will visit the Lifeclass Spa Hotels again if we get a chance."
17.06.2014,5,We have recently spent a happy week at this hotel. Centrally situated on the promenade it is convenient for all amenities. We were very well treated and our rooms were very clean and comfortable.The bathroom although small was excellent the power shower could not be faulted. Excellent food at all meals. Resturant staff worked very hard to make mealtimes happy times.We didn't use the Wai Tai Centre or the indoor pool (we don't swim). The little train to Piran is and interesting thing to do. We had two visits during the week. The local bus service is also good tickets can be bought beforehand at the newsagents shop a short distance from the hotel.We will be returning next year all things being well.
17.06.2014,2,"Well it started out nice, beautiful exterior, great location, really helpful bellman. And then we encountered the room and the not so friendly hotel management staff. We had only called an hour earlier to book a room. But for that price in Slovenia I was expecting sea side and something a bit nicer. But we were facing a parking lot, so when it came time for bed I wanted to turn on the A/C, but it wouldn't turn on. I called the front desk and the man there said he didn't know how to do it. He also said he wouldn't be able to come help since he was the only one on staff (seriously, one guy only at midnight?!) and was very rude on the phone. We didn't want to leave the balcony door open at night since there were loud kids in the next room and the noise from the cars in the parking lot. So we just slept in the heat. The next morning after breakfast we asked for a manager. I spoke with one about our concerns, she didn't care. Then, upon check out an hour later, I again asked for a manager. I was then directed to a different person, she told me that the first person wasn't a manager. And she also, didn't care. For the money, stay somewhere else where the management is friendlier. Also, Portoroz isn't that nice of a ""beach"" we heard Piran was better. Next time we'll go there. Plus, what kind of Spa hotel charges 6 Euros for the use of Robes and Towels?!"
10.06.2014,4,"This beach hotel on the promenade of this nice little seatown is on in a row of four of these hotels. I expected it to be a bit dated, but in fact it is very friendly, lot of light colors and has a good, relaxed, vibe.The rooms are good, but smallish, the breakfast is very good. The hotel is well placed between shops, the beach and restaurants of all kinds. You cannot go wrong with this one.."
30.05.2014,4,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel 1 night. The accommodations were nice. It's nothing luxurious, but it was clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfy. And I thought the price was very reasonable as well. The pools onsite are nice, and it was fun to have a casino next door. The casino is nothing exciting, considering I've been to Las Vegas & Atlantic City, but it's something fun to do should you choose. But, I have to warn you, trying to get inside the casino takes some time. They need photo ID and then they enter your information into their system. They told us we were the first ever Pennsylvanians to visit. The town of Portoroz itself is nice. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, cafes and bars in the area. I would suggest requesting a room with a view of the Adriatic. Some off the ocean front rooms have balconies, while some do not. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was very good as well. They offered many different foods/drinks."
28.01.2014,3,"the rooms were renovated (new furniture), but it is still loud as you can hear TV and shower running in neighbouring rooms. I stayed off-season, but despite that they could not get the room ready an hour earlier than in their ""general terms"". Good, tasty breakfast. Staff correct, but not genuinely friendly with big smiles."
29.12.2013,5,"Excellent food! Clean and very very friendly staff. Location is super and very easy to explore around. Swimming pool and Wai Thai center is also very nice and has great offer. Book a room with a sea view - it is amazing! Just bear in mind that fitness center is in another hotel, but only 5 minutes walking."
26.12.2013,4,"We chose hotel riviera for our october meeting. Althow the weather were not very nice(raining almost all the time) we spent there few wonderful moments. The food was delicious and hotel services were perfect. hotel rooms were clean with nice view.Hotel staff arranged everything we need.slovenia is not extremly cheap country, but this hotel is quite good value. I would reccomed it not only for business but also for private holiday."
10.09.2013,4,"Hotel is situated in front of the sea. My room has a great view but unfortunately no balcony.It was super clean and had a 12 hour free internet access which was much appreciated! Minor inadequacies like no fan speed of the air cooler and a shower with no tap which sprays water with great pressure. Breakfast was perfect with a great variety of options. Reception team is remarkable, willing to help and flexible in finding solutions! Well done!"
16.07.2013,3,"When friends asked us where we were going on holiday and we told them slovenia no one new were it was ,as we were to find out when we got there the balkan holiday rep confirmed they didn""t have many english tourists as every one doesn""t realise that slovenia does have a beautiful coastline.We flew from manchester to ljubljana then a 2 hr transfer to the hotel as there weren""t many of us going(4people) it was like having a private transfer.we didn""t pay the extra for the sea view as we thought it quite expensive and just had the standard room .the room was small but adequate as you don""t spend all day there.we went on the 6th july and when we arrived we were told the hotel pools were shut till the13th.we could have used the well being thermal pools but who want to stay inside in 35 deree heat .we think the hotel should have made more of an effort to let us use the sunbeds on the beach for free but no you had to pay 12euro""s a day for 2 sunbeds and an umrella we thought this expensive.The food choice and quality was amazing as were the staff on the restaurant,it""s a shame that the front of house staff weren""t that accomadating(please try to smile and be more welcoming)If you like walking and cycling this is the place to do it loads of cycle paths etc .plenty of bars and shops near the hotel prices reasonable for beer and wine etc .other items such as clothes seemed expensive.its easy to get about excellant bus sevice cheap and not crowded,would recomend trip to kopor for the ardant shopper and izola for beautiful walks and scenery.the salt pans are worth a walk to, 5euro entrance fee .and don""t forget to go on the boat for the fish picnic shop around on the promenade as some throw in free wine.we also went on a half day trip to trieste and the mirramar castle absolutely wonderful and not expensive addmission fee extra but only 4euro.from your hotel on portoroz you can have a lovely walk along the coast to Piran about 1 hr.stopping for the occasional beer(2.6euro large) 1euro small wine or small ice cream 1euro.Piran is a lovely town to get lost in wonderful square take the walk to the bell tower and the castle walls for fantastic views,1 euro to go in.all in allwe had a wonderful time and it""s a shame more brits don""t give it a go.then we""ll all know were Slovenia is."
30.06.2013,4,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Riviera good location easy to get to local sites walking or by bus. Close to many restaurants & bars. Food excellent good choice & always hot. Definitely recommend a superior room with sea view as other rooms can have a poor outlook.Vouchers given for a welcome cocktail & 13 free teas / coffee in the bar (per couple) nice touch!Only gripe is having to pay for pool towels & umbrellas which I have never experienced at a hotel before but, believe this is typical of the other spa hotels in the area.Would recommend as a good place to stay."
24.06.2013,5,"Having just come back from Slovenia I have to say that the Hotel Riviera is excellent. The rooms are clean, the bathrooms very good with a shower that mists you. We had a balcony that could be used from first thing in the morning until late afternoon. The restaurant provided superb meals on a buffet style with plenty of choice for vegetarians, you had your own table for evening meals with a choice of sit anywhere for breakfast. The waiting staff were all very friendly, couldn't do enough for you inasmuch as we were moved to a table by the window without our requesting it (they had noticed that we sat by the window every breakfast). The porters were also very friendly and on the ball for moving luggage. The hotel had 3 indoor swimming pools with bubbles and one outside and a large sunbathing area. it also had a spa facilities for various treatments. It is located on the seafront with bus stops just outside. I can highly recommend it and Slovenia."
19.05.2013,4,"To enjoy this hotel you really need to pay extra for a balcony & sea view, otherwise very average. The room was a reasonable size & everything was clean & the buffet breakfast & evening meal freshly cooked & well presented with a great choice. Not impressed however by school trip approach to seating us all at long tables in the dining room (we were on a tour), spoilt our dining experience. Not a lot to do in Portoroz & three nights were long enough."
13.05.2013,4,"The hotel has an excellent location with first class view of the sea.One major plus was the quality, variety and amount of food. For example at breakfast there were eggs being fried on the spot whilst at the same time a good range of cold meats etc. There was therefore a choice for either a good continental breakfast or a hot breakfast. The evening meal was again good.Another major plus were the warm, fairly large heated pools with the option of an outside area if wanted. Note a charge of 6E for hire of a robe.We paid more of a sea view and whilst we got a very good view on the eighth floor it was noisy in the early morning due to street cleaning etc.We would stay again."
5.03.2013,3,"pros:-rooms are nice and spacious, take the seaside view, its worth it-clean rooms-good breakfast-very good wai thai center-very good cleaning ladies-very good barman-very close to the walking paths which are excellent if you have small kids-very nice playgrounds only 5 minutes awaycons (this is only written in hope that management takes it as a positive criticism):- for a 4 star hotel would expect a richer variety of fish and meat at the dinner- they should take more care at refilling the cheese & ham section; if you don't mention it is hardly a chance they refill after 9am (breafast is until 10am)- only 12 hours per day of free internet (4 star hotel) - for me not acceptable in 2013 (in 1998 yes but not today)- free fitness only from 8am - 1pm (4 star hotel) you have to pay in the afternoon- you have to pay for towels at the pool (4 star hotel) and the usage of bathrobe- air temperature in the pool area definitely to low for children (it is not 30 degrees Celsius; maybe on paper but not in reality)- free coupons only available at the time you are very likely not to use them- bar in the lobby works from 9am...is hard to get a coffe from 7-9am.- some staff in the restaurant appear to be tired already and it was the 1st day of hotel openingOverall:would rather pay a little more then to get a feeling that you are being ripped off for every little thing you do accept sleeping and eating."
23.01.2013,3,"The Hotel was quite average to be honest. Nothing special and not entirely convinced that it deserves the 4 stars. The rooms are very small and we didn't request a sea view but I was surprised that we only had a wall of the apartment block across the road as a view. The hotel seemed empty. The staff were very helpful and made our two single beds into a double as soon as we asked them to.Breakfast was great, decent coffee which is always a bonus."
8.01.2013,5,".We were at the hotel from 01/02/2013 to 01/07/2013. husband, daughter, 12 years old and me. we were on the 8th floor room and the view was beautiful, the hotel is beautiful. everything is very clean. Rooms are spacious, we had an extra bed, and there was enough space in the room. you have in the room and bathrobes. daily maid changed towels, clean bathroom and room suction. Meals are excellent, the choice is huge. The pools are large enough, with clean, warm sea water. The gym is nice and spacious. the staff is very friendly. All in all a wonderful holiday"
7.01.2013,4,"We stayed at Riviera hotel for 1 night in the end of Dedember 2012 with family and group of friends. This hotel is a seafront property in Potoroz on the Istrian Peninsula with a great location on the promenade.We did not have seaview room,which would have been wonderful.The rooms are small but clean.Hotel reception staff very helpful.Superb spa: Massage services and a heated, saltwater swimming pool,salon, fitness area and children's pool area. Just few min.walk from the most beautiful town on the Slovenian coast Piran.We will definitely come back."
10.10.2012,2,"The hotel has a very good potential, but there are some very annoying issues that could damage your vacation. Pros:The breakfast is rich, with fresh fruits and vegetables (quite rare in Slovenia) and quality coffee.Location is niceIf you're lucky to get a sea view room, you'll enjoy it.Internet is free (Wifi and a public computer near reception)Cons:Let's start with the room. If you're not lucky enough to get a sea view room, like we did, you are destined to see the parking lot, garbage bins, and a close by apartment hotel. I added a picture showing you the view from our room, so you won't be disappointed like we did. What made us furious was the greediness and stinginess of hotel management and owners. Here are just a few examples:If you want to use the bathrobe, you have to pay for it.If you want to use the sun umbrellas in the hotel pool(!), you have to pay for it!If you want a beach towel for the beach or the pool, you have to pay extra.If you want a baby cot, you have to pay extra (unlike many hotels, including hotels in Bled)Don't have high expectations for hotel beach as well. It's just concrete pavement and then deep water. Defiantly not child friendly. Plus, as you'd expect from this hotel, you have to pay for a the bed and the sun umbrella, and it's not private, and people keep walking near you.Because we traveled with a child and an infant, and we didn't want them to mess with the minibar, we kindly asked the receptionist to empty the minibar. It took them 2 days(!) and then they wanted to charge me for that, saying I'll use it as a fridge. So I had to tell them to take the minibar itself out. Though we were 2 adults, 1 child and a baby, we only got 2 towels for our room (and 2 hand towels). When we asked for another towel, well, we were kindly asked to pay extra.At checkout the receptionist wanted to charge us for parking in the Hotel parking. Only After I refused to pay claiming that their website says parking is free-of-charge, he made a few phone calls and canceled the charge.During our 5 day stay, the receptionists failed to tell us that there were special activities for the kids. We only found them by an accident.I strongly recommend you think twice before checking in Hotel Riviera."
23.09.2012,4,"Stayed 4 nights mid Sepember in a sea view balcony room on the 5th floor. We were part of a group doing a tour of Slovenia, the Riviera was our second stop.Our room had a wonderful view over the harbour and out to sea, with a balcony and two chairs. Excellent evenings sitting with a bottle of wine watching the world (at least the Portoroz world )go by . Some of our group were disapointed as they had rooms at the back , looking at a brick wall, so it is worth paying the extra for a sea view.There was slight problem with traffic noise because our wooden double glazed balcony doors didn't fit at the top so let noise in. Also the room though comfortable was in need of an refurbishment.The screen over the bath did not fit,consquently when the shower was used, the bathroom flooded and had to be mopped up everytime with the bath mat !!!!!!!On the plus side, the food was good and varied, both at dinner and breakfast time.The house wine was good and inexpensive, and the coffee shop just outside the hotel served gorgeous cakes and coffee. Transport is inexpensive and a visit to Piran is a ""must do"".All in all the Riviera is a good bet for a stay in Portoroz"
17.09.2012,3,"Four day break as part of a tour. This was expected to be a time to relax., Our room was very small; no balcony; only one dining type chair in double room. We had to lift the chair over the bed if anyone wanted to cross the room. Nowhere outside to sit and sunbathe except by the pool which had many rules and regulations and charged for sun shade; was entered by way of chip card, which had to be returned on leaving, if lost a fine levied. There were charges for bathrobe (I told the receptionist that I didn't want to buy it, but she failed to see the humour and wanted six euros for the use of).There was a garden beneath our room in which I could have relaxed but this was closed for some reason.The food was quite good but I will not return to this hotel as it did not meet my needs"
7.09.2012,4,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, food at breakfast and dinner very good. We enjoyed the fact that you could use the nearby Hotel Grand swimming pool facilities, the only bizarre things was on a Tuesday our hotel swimming pool was closed until 14:00hrs and the same for the Hotel Grand on a Thursday, but at least you could use the other hotels facilities. Room nice with 26"" Philips flat screen TV and free Wi-Fi in the room, if not a bit slow 300kb. There was a shower and no bath. Would have been nice to have a sea view, as our room was at the back facing a concrete wall.No a great deal to do in the resort, the local buses are cheep if you buy the tickets from the news agent first for 60 cent each way to Piran. 2.70€ each way to Koper on local bus, buying the tickets on the bus."
15.08.2012,5,"Exquisite hotel with marvelous Spa and huge fantastic indoor pool, serves delicious food and has spacious rooms. Experienced courteous personnel who even made the effort to prepare for my friends (who were arriving late at night and would miss dinner) some cold platter, how thoughtful! The convenience of having your car parked by the valet and retrieved from the garage is one fine service. Altogether, nothing to complain about... merely praises... KUDOS!"
13.02.2012,5,We stayed for 4 nights here and we had an amazing view on the seventh floor were you could see a beautiful view of the area and the sea. We had a clean room and a great service from the stuff. Fantastic place to stay in Portoroz
12.02.2012,5,Great hotel and location! I stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Riviera in Portoroz and was very impressed with the facilities and staff... Definitely recommended!
11.02.2012,5,"We had a chance to stay in Slovenija hotel for 3 nights after our trip to Venice.The room was nice and clean with a great sea view and living room,that had a sofa bed too.Staff and food was fantastic.Heated sea-water pool was so relaxing.Great located,near shops,bars and other restaurants with local menu.We think it could suit anybodys needs.Awesome spa services to choose from at extra cost.We would like to come back in the Summer."
11.02.2012,4,"Great service.great hotel!In a great spot in portoroz Slovenia, the hotel offers a great vacation hotel!I would recommend it to all of you!"
11.02.2012,5,"We spent a long weekend in this hotel in a room with the perfect view, just like a postcart even in February. The room was very spacious, food was great and the service excellent.I hope I'll have the chance to test it in the summer and stay longer."
29.10.2011,5,"I spent 2 nights in this hotel in October.Of course it wasnt crowded.I was in a room with sea view- unbelievable even in October.Food was very good.I had water-bed for the first time in my life,the only issue was that you have to pay for the towel robe.Also i expected that sauna would be free as a spa hotel."
16.09.2011,3,"Just had a 3 day stay at The hotel Riviera, rooms were large, if you can upgrade go for a room with a sea view. Every meal time was very crowded and busy. Food was O.K. Great location right on the sea front."
12.09.2011,3,"We stayed at Hotel Riviera out of the five LifeClass hotels next to each other. We stayed at a room overlooking the sea which is across the main street so it was a bit too loud. An outside pool belongs to the hotel, which is pretty small, so we went to the public beach instead. There are many sun beds there that you have to pay for, but it is cheaper for hotel guests. The beach at Riviera is not sandy, there is actually a concrete walkway along the sea and you can go into the water on steps, but a little further there is also a sandy beach. The hotel room was good altogether, cleaned and towels changed every day (they provide an extra towel for the swimming pool). The food was not so fine, I would rather recommend to eat at local restaurants, there are many on the main street. The staff was quite unfriendly, but they speak English and can help if you're trying hard. There was a really well equipped fitness room at another LifeClass hotel that you can use for free. We did not try the inside wellness bath but it looked very nice.The location is great, there is a bus stop next to the hotel, where you can catch the bus to Piran."
14.08.2011,5,"We are returning guests, it is our fifth consecutive summer at Riviera. And that tells already everything.You cannot beat the view from this hotel, and yes, it is beautiful. Our only issue with the room was that the bed was way too hard for us. Luckily there is a thai massage center in the hotel so we could let our backpain caused by the bed disappear by them.The breakfast was really generous, as well as the dinner.We also loved the pool area.The hotel beach is very close, it is like 50 meters.The only issue we had during our stay was in the hotel beach restaurant ""Medusa"".The table cloth was dirty, and the waitress was a joke. She looked bored when she took our order, taking no notes on it. Then I though oh, what a good memory she has. But, after a few minutes she came back and asked us again what did we order...When we finally got the food, we got only two of the three items ordered. So she was not a memory master, as I originally thought, she just hated her job and was totally disinterested in doing it well. So I can recommend the Riviera, but avoid its beach restaurant ""Medusa""."
22.07.2011,4,"My husband and I spent a week here recently, having booked it as part of a 2 centre holiday in Slovenia ( the 2nd week was in Lake Bled). We booked the holiday through Crystal Travel and took their advice re which hotels to use.We loved the Hotel Riviera-beautiful location, great facilities and lovely evening meals each day. We never once felt inclined to eat out as food was so good and varied.My only complaint was having to pay for the use of pool towels -a charge of 3 euro a day each. I never take beach towels with me when going to a hotel as any other hotel I ever stayed in would have had complimentary towels for pool use. Having said that, we were thrilled with everything else. We had a lovely room with balcony on the top floor with fabulous views over the sea ( room 506). Not all rooms have a balcony so maybe we were just fortunate. I was glad the hotel (and travel agent) took note of my request for a high floor.(I should say my husband was a little put out by music which was played a lot of nights in a bar/club across the road-it went on quite late, into the early hours of the morning, but it was a relatively small inconvenience when we were so happy with everything else)."
15.07.2011,4,"Spent almost a week at the Riviera with my partner and our experience was good. Our double room had a big balcony facing the sea. Some of the rooms have only small french balcony. Hotel has couple of pools and one of them is outside. The sea is only a 50 metres away. They also have some spa treatments but we didn't try them. Hotel guests can use the swimming pools for free. Guests don't have to pay an entrance fee to the beach but the deck chairs cost a little. Breakfast was included with the price and there were plenty to choose from. I especially loved their fresh fruits.The room itself wasn't anything special but satisfactory to our needs. There was AC, safe and a minibar. Everyone at the hotel were friendly and polite. Hotel has a free WiFi but the signal wasn't very good at the farthest rooms. Also there was a limit for 1 hour per day.Hotel is situated at the center of Portoroz and there are lots of restaurants nearby. On the weekend there were people partying and the noise from the bars came through. If you're a light sleeper, I recommend you bring earplugs with you."
14.06.2011,4,"LifeClass hotel in Portoroz is a good place for a SPA holiday. If you enjoy massages, you are at the right place. The hotel has 4 different SPA centers: thalasso (Vichy type), thai, indian and beauty. Each center offers a big variety of treatments at a good quality/price ratio. The centers are all clean and each has a special atmosphere. It is definetly a nice place to relax. The hotel also has a set of pools, where you can relax and get hydro massages at different temperatures. Rooms are very simple for a 4 stars hotel, do not expect a big luxurious place. Rooms are clean though, and the hotel is conveniently located on the sea side. The best thing about the hotel, apart from the SPA centers, is the bar on the ground floor. It has a fantastic choice of cakes, and they are all excellent! Food in general was good (buffet on half board) and presented a variety of dishes, cold and hot, that were all nice and fresh. Again, it is not luxurious but it is quite simple and nice, and the buffet is pretty big so anyone will find something to their taste. From Portoroz, you can enjoy a nice walk to Piran, a beautiful village that stands out on the sea. You can also rent a car (the guy who runs the AVIS office is really nice) for a day or two and explore Slovenia. Ljubljana, a beautiful city, and Lake Bled would be the highlights of our own day-trip."
12.09.2010,3,"Spent a week at the Riviera on half board. The hotel was of fairly modern design and situated in the heart of the small coastal resort of Portoroz, just across the road from the sea. Positive: unlike other reviewers we did not experience any of the noise from the nearby bar as the season had just ended. The room was spacious and comfortable, but only had a shower. Negative: the evening meal was split into two sittings, and when the doors opened it was like the first day of the sales! The food itself was generally on the cool side, and not particularly varied. With a selection of good nearby restaurants I would suggest, where possible, to stick to B&B."
20.08.2010,3,"I stayed in Hotel Slovenjia for one week. Great location! Average hotel though, but worth the money."
15.08.2010,3,"Pros:1. The food was really good. There were several choices of tasty meals at breakfast and dinner.2. The room service was quite good provided some gentle tipping. 3. The pool was fiiled in with sea water and was rather large. 4. The TV included English ( BBC, CNN, Discovery Channel, History Channel, Cartoon Network and Animal Planet), Italian, Russian, and German channels. 5. The parking, though it was not free was only 3.50 per day. Cons:1. The most glaring negative aspect was clearly the restaurant in front of the hotel which played extremely loud, disruptive music from 9pm until 1 am every day. 2. The air conditioning unit inside of the room was extremely loud and did not work well. This did not couple well with the loud restaurant since opening the windows meant no sleep till past midnight. 3. Though there was one computer in the main lobby which had free highspeed internet the fee for slow wireless internet in the rooms was 10 euros for every 5 days. 4. After crossing the street to visit the non-childfriendly beach, you are faced with the fact that there are no free beach chairs (4.50 each) and no free beach umbrellas (4.50 each). Therefore, for a free visit to the beach you need to sunbathe on the concrette sidewalk where pedestrians walk by the hundreds. In order for small children to enjoy a soft sandy beach (the beach immediatelly in front of the hotel rocky, and about 1.5 meters deep from the start) you must walk for about 600 meters (still not free). PS: Bring your own towels. 5. The gym and fitness center was not in the hotel and was free from 8 am to 1 pm. 6. Be very careful when showering in order to prevent apocalyptic bathroom floods."
7.03.2015,2,"You still feel - and see the days of socialism in this hotel. The breakfast is poor, the hot food (at breakfast) is lukewarm. Spa: They charge extra for bathrobes. Towels for the pool area cost € 4,00 per piece. Pool area has the socialist charm of the 60s, the plastic chairs are so close to each other that you cannot pass between. The buffet of the spa is void of any food. Wellness area: 5 minutes walk along the main road was closed for repair without giving notice to hotel customers.Room 839: Next to the elevator and whenever a lift arrived you heard the loud ""ping"" of its arrival. Room was very small, the bathroom the same and the toilette paper had the feel of newspaper, an other clear indicator that the hotel tries to safe money... on its guests. - We announced the night before departure that we would be leaving just before 7 am and we were promised coffee to go. Well, the door to the dining room was locked and the cleaning lady outside just pointed at her watch. Conclusion: Never again a so-called Life Class hotel!"
2.03.2015,3,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel. We have chosen it because of a pool as the swimming helps our sun to recover after injury.We have a nice time although the hotel is nothing special for 4* hotel.Room was big enough although very basic.The bed for the son made out of sofa took quite a place. It was very hard and with a big frame. Not nice. Our beds were OK and comfortable. Lights were very poor and only on the wall above beds and the table. I couldn't read in the evening. Also the wardrobe is too small. I don't imagine how a family can spend a week or two holidays here. Where to put all clothes? But room was clean and without any comments. A balcony was big with a table and 2 chairs. But if we would stay longer on holidays we would choose the room with a sea view as this time we look directly to the backyaerd and to the other hotel and it was not a nice view. But we know this when booking and this didn't matter this time.The receptionists were kind but somehow anemic. Without smile and like robots. I haven't got a good feeling for the first time. But they kindly helped our son with a phone when he had a problem and I can just say thank you.We had some drinks and coffe at the hotel bar at the reception. It is a nice bar and a man who served us in the evening was very proffesional and kind as I thinh the waiter must be.The staff at the restaurant was also very nice and enthusiastic with a smile on the face what I missed at the reception.Although the food was good we missed more meat for a dinner - like a steak or chicken or something. To be honest there was the meat but mostly in sauces.A breakfast was good but eggs were not fried enough. This is the only bad thing.We loved the swimming pool - bright and clean and not crowded. However we noticed some food on the floor (although it is forbiden to eat at the swimming pool - people really don't obey the rules) and there were a lot of ants arround. But they cleaned it when I told them. The pool bar is only opened from 11.00 on (a little too late for us as we were early). Nice bar but the coffee was really bad. Nevertheless we enjoyed swimming.We didn't use the massage in WAI TAI center - what a pitty. I was there once before and it was great.But in all we had a good relaxing time and this is what we came for.Portorož itself is more crowded in the summer. In this time of the year it is boring. Many people were out during the day as it was really nice weather, but in the evening streets were empty. More people during the weekend. But it was great to walk along the beach.I recommend this hotel and all others in Life class hotel chain if you like wellnes, but I would not go here for holidays in the summer."
15.02.2015,5,"We spent only one night and two days unfortunately. The staff is really nice and profesional. They have wonderful wellness offer, due to Valentinas day WaiTai was completely sold out, make sure you order in advance for wellness activities. They offered us late check out - till 6pm in the afternoon. Dinner and breakfast were both excellent with wide offer. We are coming back."
10.12.2014,4,"We stayed mid tour 15/9 to 18/9/2014. We had requested an upgrade on booking to sea view with balcony, only to find we had a junior suite with an extra lounge/TV room and 2 good sized balconies overlooking the Portoroz Bay and marina with beautiful views. Impressed with the aircon, which worked perfectly. The staff were very friendly and courteous and a short walk - took us along the seafront to the town with seafront cafes and the nearby pier was a perfect point to capture stunning sunsets that can't be seen from the hotel balcony. Night view across the bay was lovely but you are away from the town centre, not a problem for us, as we were close to the pier to catch a tour round the bay to Piran (within easy bus distance). Breakfast was good and evening meals were reasonable,"
11.11.2014,4,"You could say 4 stars exactly. Breakfast and dinner very very tasty. Good variety of food. Drinks at dinner are for supplement - thats the only down point.Room: for triple room very small , not much place to walk around the room. Balcony also not so big. Anyway the room was very clean.Wellness -quite busy , but overall everything ok.Parking: a bit difficult to find free space. You have parking lots behind hotel. But its uphill and difficult to walk with all suitcases.Service: nothing to add. All are very helpfull and smiling :) Specialy staff in restaurant ,which is nice to see."
20.10.2014,4,"The hotel is nice. Location, rooms, especially the rooms overlooking the sea. It's clean, staff is generally speaking friendly and accommodating.I've been coming to LifeClass resorts for quite some time and have tried out most of the hotels withing the hotel range. I also use other services of the hotels, such as the Wai Thai wellness center inside Riviera hotel.The experience with Wai Thai during my last visit was far below average. Not the massage itself, but the way the staff of the center as well as of the hotel treated me because of a misunderstanding on the price of the massage.I booked thru the phone. The reservation centre confirmed the price of 39 euro per massage I wanted so I booked another one for the following day. When checking out and when I wanted to pay, to my surprise the price of a single massage was 57 euro.The hotel receptionist said she or the hotel didn't have anything to do with that so I should go and speak to the massage centre. I did. The blond receptionist was rude and said the prices are clearly listed on their price list. Something I didn't check, because I trusted the reservation centre. I freaked out primarily of their bluntness and refused to pay the full price.Went back to the hotel and after a bit of haggling, which I found completely out of place decided to go to their swimming pool so they could arrange it between themselves.One thing is for certain ... After consecutive poor experience with Wai Thai center I won't be coming back. Ever. I've had it this time.What I can't understand is that they blamed each other for this and were sending me back and forth and the hotel claiming they didn't have to do anything to do with it."
25.09.2014,4,"We have stayed in the hotel Riviera three nights in spring for the rate of 54 euro per person per night (B&B plan, room #6503, sea view). It was the first hotel, where I have encountered this billing practice. Usually, it is per room per night. Anyway, you have to add here 6 euro for the hire of each bathrobe.The location is second to none in Portoroz with the promenade and the beach just across the road. It is very convenient that they have a large parking at the back of the hotel, which was free of charge. Because of this open parking lot, I would strongly recommend to take rooms with sea view. Do not expect all of them to have balconies, as ours didn't have it.The room itself was very clean, but smallish and quite basic for a four-star hotel. The bathroom was extremely uncomfortable with the toilet and shower cabin much too close together. Moreover there was a poor choice of TV channels and a paid Wi-Fi! Despite all that, the price was quite reasonable, so for short stays it is probably acceptable to put up with certain inconveniences. The breakfast was fairly good, as well as the buffet dinner we decided to have one night in the main restaurant, especially considering the price paid for it. The restaurant staff was very friendly and helpful.To sum it up - a perfect location, good combination of price and quality (at least in low season), but definitely not a 4 star superior hotel."
1.09.2014,5,"This is my tenth year that I have been in Portoroz, mainly in Hotel Riviera. Great accommodation, excellent food, the seaside is 50 meters away, surrounded by cafe bars and restaurants. If you plan to come with family or not you will not be mistaken. Its a perfect holiday place."
11.08.2014,5,"This was our first trip to Hotel Riviera in Portoroz, Slovenia. Lovely hotel and lovely resort. So clean and nice staff.Excellent value for money .Good to be able to visit sister hotels with superb indoor pools.at the Lifeclass Spa.all within walking distance. All free for guestsGreat choice at breakfast and dinner. Easy walk to bars at night..We had a sea view room which I would recommendLovely seafront private area just over the road. Quality. .Have to pay for loungers howeverPiran is a must see, just a short bus ride away and we also managed a day trip to Lake Bled and a nice day out to Trieste In Italy"
29.07.2014,4,"I stayed in the hotel while travelling for business in July 2014. It was an excellent choice! I was amazed by the Lifeclass Spa offer and high end service provided. Another thing that I loved was the breakfast, the offer is vast and cooks are preparing eggs, pancakes, etc. in the breakfast room, produce is local.Staff was friendly and polite. Hotel is very big so even in the busy summer season I did not have the impression it was overcrowded. I will return to this hotel again."
22.03.2015,3,"From five star hotel I would expect more flawless experience, very aged room, had to ask three times to get the room sorted out for my daughter, to get her a bathrobe and slippers for visiting the pool area (we booked family room and this should already be taken care prior to our arrival), the pool complex is OK, but not amazing. Sauna park (which is not included in room price) and breakfast buffet are the only five stars experience in this hotel by my opinion."
10.03.2015,5,"I suppose that when you are paid to go to an upmarket seaside resort to work, get put up in a 5 star hotel with large comfortable rooms, an indoor swimming pool, fitness, spa with amazing massages, pretty good food (the only thing that could have been better) and efficient, friendly staff, I suppose you can't complain. So I won't. Thanks"
6.03.2015,5,"Travelling with Triplets in a five star hotel is not always easy, particulary expecting 5 Star quality for Business and pleasure. This hotel has convinced me very much. High quality dinner, breakfast, roomservice and Service. Very friendly team, cosy rooms and very clean. Nice amenities. I strongly recommend this hotel!"
15.12.2014,3,"The Hotel was ok!But the restaurant was absolutely not worth it!!Staff was very rude, did not smile and did not care about the guest!!Food was old and dry!The Rooms was a bit small, and also the shower was very smallReception was excellent!!"
26.10.2014,4,"We wanted to book directly at the hotel, but we couldn't get them, so we booked through Booking.com. But when we got there the staff was very friendly, the room was nicely furnished, food was good. We loved the piano music at dinner and the live music in the bar was very good. Some of the waiters were very young and inexperienced, but they were sweet.The room had a beautiful sea view, but there were loud parties across the street every evening."
22.10.2014,4,"The hotel is nicely situated in a central area of Portoroz with shopping experience and nice sea views.Service was very good, room clean and comfortable. The breakfast was also at good standards.However, the hotel is appreciated by tourists and you have to accommodate with sometimes noisy people."
19.08.2014,5,"Very helpful staff. Great breakfast but only stayed two nights so we didn't eat in the hotel. It is very clean, very nice room of about average size with a comfortable bed. Location is convenient, everything was within easy walking distance. The only downsize is the strength of wifi."
18.08.2014,4,"I stayed in this hotel in July with another family and 4 small children altogether. The room was very good (very nice bathroom) and maybe because it was a triple room it was quite spacious. (Could not say the same for the double room though). The hotel has super kind staff especially the reception team ( where I was impressed with their patience and the fact that they spoke ALL major foreign languages) as the check-in and out process went smoothly. The hotel has free of charge parking and a valet service available. The hotel breakfast was a superb experience with incredible variety of pastry, fresh juices, fruits, cheese etc. Make sure you take a table on the gallery as it gives somewhat better view than the ones inside. The downside is that this hotel has a regular ten days maintenance of the indoor swimming pool - in July (!). However, the guests have full access (towels included) to the pool of the adjacent hotel Slovenia that is literally 20 m away. The hotel has the best location in Portoroz - across the street from good restaurants and clubs. It has an exclusive beach with kids club and other facilities. The rooms and the hotel area were covered with good wi-fi. Unique code to be requested at the reception. (slight annoyance is that it has to be re-entered each time you get back to the hotel)."
13.08.2014,3,"Being in the area in high season, hotel is not cheap. Most rooms are tired and in need of refurbishment. You need to ask for a refurbished room to stay to get a nice room (and you will be charged extra). Having been in the hotel for several weeks, I have managed to stay on every floor and my rooms were facing in every direction my suggestions are as follows: see view is great but you also have a view of the main road which is incredibly noisy until early hours so go for higher floors if you can. Back rooms / side rooms you will trade off more quiet areas for light. Rooms facing back are relatively dark (mainly due to the near by trees). The comment about the beach, well you can pay €5 to stay there and having been there, no-one have ever checked where I was from so you may be able to go irrespective. Wifi is free but the quality will depend on your room. In some rooms the signal was very poor and would support facetime, in others, signal was ok. You will not be able to watch freeview etc. Overall, hotel is pretty average."
20.07.2014,4,"Very good all-round hotel, not too expensive for what it offers.The only downside is closed indoor swimming pool every year for 10 days in the middle of July.Excellent exclusive beach and perfect hotel location."
6.05.2014,4,"We stayed in Grand Hotel Portoroz in April 2014. Hotel was recently renovated. Hotel room we have was nice and on first floor. As we are two adults and one teenager we got a room with two rooms plus balcony and bath. I liked hotel room have not only shower but a real bath. Wi-Fi internet connection is free and connection is fast. You need to ask on reception desk to get a free access code to be able to connect to hotel Wi-Fi. Hotel room have new 42 inch Smart TV so, you can plug in your USB stick and listen your music or watch movie from your USB stick.Breakfast is from 7:00 till 11:00 am and dinner is from 19:00 till 21:30. So plenty of time to get for a meal when it is not a lot of people... Both breakfast and dinners are offering a lot of choices so you will have a lot of choices. I liked direct connection to Hotel wellness SPA with swimming pool. If you wish you can also have a nice wellness SPA massage. Hotel also provide you with free access to swimming pools during all your time of staying at hotel. Bathrobe is provided for free in your hotel room. Fitness is also available in same hotel. You have a lot of possibility to see around Portoroz itself, most of things is in walking distance. Post office and newspaper office and pharmacy is in same complex. Stuff is kind and helpful. Check in and Check out fast and accept most of credit cards.I would like to thank specially to consigier which help with car parking and luggage. And I would like to mention a great professional attitude of hotel reservation team manager: Alan Milosevic."
3.05.2014,4,"Stayed there few times, last in summer 13.The most positive advantage of this hotel is Medusa Exclusive beach.This beach is the reason I went to this hotel in summer instead to Metropol or Kempinski-both lack of sea beach.Double rooms in newer area are quite small.It 's best to take some suite.Food is quite average, as variety of breakfast and dinner is more for 4*hotel.Staff is professional, polite, I have no complaints over them, cleaning also.The main fazit of this hotel is now, as they have rennovated some rooms, still food."
14.04.2014,5,"We were 5 days in this hotel, everything very clean, efficient service and friendly people. It 'just a few meters from the beach and there are many nice places to see nearby. This was my first time in Slovenia and in general it seemed to me a very civil and clean country."
10.12.2013,5,"Very nice and big hotel in center of Portoroz. The bigest impresion for us was big and tasty brekfast. Rooms was clean and big, towels and evrythink was very clean, hotel has two pools, and realy good beach and amenities on it. Guest can use for free. Olso, there was an evening programme for the guest with the life music. Staff was realy helpful. Highly recomend."
22.11.2013,5,We stayed 5 days . Made trips to Postonja - Lipica - Rovinj - Porec etc.At the hotel we had a very good breakfast and also a very good diner . They all were very kindly. Nice room with sea-view.I coud recommand this hotel also for the quietness in and around it. For the people liking strand hollidays : small beach.
9.10.2013,5,"Hotel is very modern inside, everything is in good condition, so it is a pleasure to be there. Rooms are very big and clean. View from the rooms is very nice (sea and mountains), the town is quite so you do not hear the noice while sitting on the balcony. Food from a room service is tasty (if you are lazy to go somewhere just order it). The staff is polite and helpful. The hotel has 2 swimming pools with thermal water, guests of the hotel can use it for free. Also a doctor can suggest you some extra procedures and treatments (doctor visit and extra treatments are not free).The location is good, the sea and all the restaurants on the seaside are just 2 mins away, you just need to cross the road. Evgeniya"
2.09.2013,5,"I can highly recommend this hotel. We felt very much welcomed by the staff and their service all around. The room was quite spacious with beautiful views overlooking the sea. The half board restaurant has offered various dishes with big selection of starters, salads and fish/meat/pasta as main course. The selection of little cakes for dessert were amazing. Have some wine for your dinner and enjoy the big selection of local wines. The service was great whether it was the valet parking or the restaurant for dinner. Also, there is an amazing selection of massages and various treatments with beauty salon and hair dresser.There is a gym, kids play area and a healthy snack place. Check our their smoothies and snacks if you are into raw and vegan food. The only thing is that the kids area needs some improvement.Have tried the Thai massage which was exceptional. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you are in Thailand and the massage is as unique. There is also a private beach across the road which provides you with towels, beds and also massages. Its a nice shaded area with very comfy beds and a snack place for drinks and some food. The outdoor massage is almost as good as indoor.The Cafe downstairs in the hotel has the most amazing cakes and a nice seating area outside. We have enjoyed their cocktails some evenings during our stay. All in all, a very nice stay with great service and very helpful staff. We would definitely come back!"
14.08.2013,4,"It was the first time for us in Slovenia & we enjoyed it a lot. Reception, especially Jelica Jungic was more then helpful in all the issues. The rooms are clean, I would deffinetely recommend to visit the thermal pool & book some massages. We've booked breakfast first only, but then ordered dinner as well, the food was fresh & tasty every time."
14.08.2013,5,It was the 2 time in Portoroz. We spent 12 days in Grand Hotel and had great time there. We had not only remarkable time in the beach but also had a necessary medical treatment there. Our children also had fun there. In the evenings we had dinner in the restaurants along the beach. Specially I would like to mention Porto del Mar restaurant and bar with a perfect cuisine and karaoke. Very nice evening programm in the hotel bar was also relaxing.
1.08.2013,5,Me and my wife pas 4 days at this hotel. We really had a nice trip. The staff was extremely helpfull! The service was excelent. The wiew from my room was amaizing. Thank you for everything. I will come back again for sure.
18.07.2013,4,"This was the second time we spent a week in the hotel, which is very comfortable and at a prime location in Portoroz. Rooms are not spacious but well equipped (except for rather poor toiletry, for a 5* hotel!) and clean. The breakfast is excellent, served until 11am, so it can be also brunch. The valet service is very good, a place in the garage should be reserved beforehand. Twelve hours of free Internet in the rooms but you can topped it up for 10E per week for an unlimited access. Nice beach (Meduza exclusive), with plenty of shade. Major downsides are cold sea (happens quite often in that part of the Adriatic Sea) and the lack of open-air pool (the only one in the neighboring hotel Riviera was closed during our stay). This should be a 5* hotel?! So, we could swim only in thermo-mineral closed pools - which is not for everybody's skin - our daughter got serious allergic reactions!Went for dinner to Piran (1.5 km walk along the coast), excellent restaurants and nice small town!All in all, a pleasant stay but not for swim-lovers."
29.04.2013,4,"Just returned from a short break with a friend and were recommended the Grand Hotel and Spa.We were on the fifth floor with a lovely view of the coast. My only advise is that the seafront can be noisy at night and if you feel this would bother you then I suggest a room perhaps facing away from the front.Overall the service was excellent and reception staff were helpful and friendly.It is not a new hotel and not five star compared to Asian or Middle Eastern properties but none the less it was comfortable.The Icing on the cake is the Spa - both my friend and I travel throughout Asia and the Middle East for business and the treatments we received (Thai, Ayurvedic , and Thalasso) were professional and excellent and I would say amongst the best I have experienced. The Sauna Park is great as are the mineral pools. We traveled in April 2013 when the town is not too busy. ."
28.02.2013,5,"My daughter and I had chocolate wraps @ Spa Real today. It was AMAZING. Our therapists Ana + Lorena were excellent. It was so relaxing and my skin feels terrific. Gracias mujeres.A job very well done .,,"
30.08.2012,4,"Me and my wife stayed here for 4 nights.We liked it very much. It is a great place to stay for a vacation.Hotel provides great service and very friendly personal. We were impressed.Also hotel provides a great beach arrangement, well organized andit is like 100 meters from the beach."
15.08.2012,3,"I and my daughter just got back from another Slovenian holiday. Slovenia is one of my favorite spots in whole Europe therefore I try to visit a least once a year, sometimes even twice. The coastal towns of Portoroz & Piran are delightful & lively, Lake Bled located within the Julienne Alps is breathtaking and serene while the beautiful baroque city of Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital is exciting and so rich in history & arts... Whenever I am in Portoroz, I stay at one of the Life Class chains which namely are; Grand, Riviera, Slovenija, Apollo, Neptune & Mirna. Through the years, I have spent time in all these hotels, not just alone but with family and friends too, occupying several rooms at a time! However, during my visit last week in Portoroz (my last was in March this year), we booked in Grand. The last time I stayed there was in 2000, why? Because we had such a bad experience! We checked-in in this beautiful hotel, were assigned wonderful rooms with seaview but voila! The airconditioning system was malfunctioning! That summer of 2000 was horrendous with temperatures rising up to 40° centigrade and without proper airconditioning in the room, one would simply pass out from the heat which was actually what happened to one of my friends, we were a group of 9 at that time! We kept complaining but relatively nothing was done. After 48hrs. of unbearable heat, my (late) husband said ""I can't take this anymore, pack up, we'll return home to Vienna!"" Me, pregnant at that time and still going through a never ending ""morning sickness"" was the most suffering from the heat! I decided to walk down the road to look for another accommodation and prevent our holiday from being spoiled. After several attempts with other hotels (those I mentioned above) which were all fully booked, I came to Riviera and was told that the only available was the Presidential Suite and 2 other double deluxe rooms. Without having second thoughts I immediately took these accommodations (despite the painful price tag, lol!). The Pres. Suite which has 2 bedrooms, a split level (living & dining room downstairs) with a lovely winding staircase and huge balconies was for me & my husband plus two other friends and the 2 other rooms for our other friends. And so in the middle of the night my group and I transferred and the rest of the holiday was saved & enjoyed to the fullest! In between then & now, I have stayed in Life Class' chains and have always been satisfied. I very, very seldom try other hotels except when Life Class is full, so I opt for Hotel Bernardin up the road towards Piran or at Marita down the road towards Lucija. This year having comeback from a 6week Southeast Asian holiday in June til July, I felt that I still didn't have enough of the sea and so off I drove with my 11 year old daughter to Portoroz and stayed in Grand (after 11yrs!)... To my dismay, we were assigned a room again where the aircondition was hardly functioning! Though the staff tried to appease me by saying it will be repaired in due time, I was still sweating in the night because the system was merely blowing air, and so little it was! One receptionist even said that the others rooms were programmed with 24 or 25° temperature and the guests weren't complaining at all! And that they have programed mine at 23°! I said it can't be 23° because how on earth would one perspire so profusely like we did? Anyway, even 23° is less! There isn't anything more relaxing and invigorating but to be able to sleep deeply at night in a cool room, especially after a wholeday of laying under the sun at the beach. Anyway, until after we checked out, the problem insisted. Sometimes it will work but most of the time it fails... For a 5* hotel such as Grand, one would expect that airconditioning system will function splendidly and would be individually regulated at one's desire, sadly that is not the case with Grand. It had a poor airconditioning system 11 years ago and it remains so until today! Yes, the internet too is very slow plus considering their room rates, they should at least include internet access free of charge!In fairness, other that these shortages, the Life Class chain is still highly recommendable but perhaps try not getting into Grand if you'll have other choice! Tip: The Riviera Hotel is wonderful!!!!"
20.07.2012,2,I've been there for just one night. The hotel has a 5 stars board on the entrance but that's it. It is a kind of average and pretty old 4 stars.Room was big but with basic and old furniture.Nice view of the sea from the balcony.The wifi is crap. It took me almost 2 hours to download a few files since the quality of the connections was really bad and changing constantly.Breakfast is ok but service not as you would expect.
19.07.2012,5,"Grand Hotel Portoroz is probably the best hotel in Portoroz and on the Slovenian coast. It is not cheap at all but it is worth: the location is superb, the beach is great (though the sea is not very warm) and the entrance (towels, umbrella and sun chairs) is included in the room price, the staff is friendly and helpful (they even park your car in the garage), one-hour free internet per day (10EUR for unlimited use for 5 days), and very tasty breakfast! And what a cake shop!Two minuses: the toiletry in the room must be better, and the open pool is a joke (30cm deep) for a hotel of this class.Hihgly recommended."
12.02.2012,5,I spent 3 nights in a suite of the hotel and there is amazing view from the room!I woke up and could see the sun rise and the see at the same time.It is a great hotel!
22.08.2011,4,"Comfortable rooms, very friendly and professional staff, great location and facilities. The only thing that missed to give remark excellent is the beach service. We came around noon and we're told that beach is full. You do not expect in five star that you shall come early in the moorning to take your place. Anyway, the beach-boy managed to combine some sunchairs, so the problem was solved in five minutes."
21.08.2011,4,"I stayed few times in this hotel and I must admit hotel is one of the best on the slovenian coast. Hovever there are some things which should be improved.The spa center is very well mantained and I loved expecially Ayurveda center. But on other hand a restaurant in this hotel doesn't provide Ayurveda food.The bar in the front opens only at 8 am, what I found a little bit late for early birds.Lights on the balcony are a little bit annoying in the evening as they are switched off automatically at 11 pm"
18.10.2008,3,"Grand Hotel Portoroz is a ""grand"" dissapointment ! Officially claimed as 5star hotel - this must be a local joke. This property can barely be called poor 4star hotel full of group tourists. By saying that I have in mind the guest corridors, guest rooms and its amenities. The highlight is a message in the wardrobe saying that bathrobes are changed every 4 days. If we wished to be changed more frequently we can request that at an additional charge. Very sad looking are also the bathroom amenities that are limited to basics only (cheap soap, shower gel, shower cap and lotion). Bed matresses are extremely old and therefore extremely uncomfortable (I couldnt sleep much), not to mention sheets full of hair from previous guests!!!To mention some positive remarks: very good LCD TV with exellent channel selection, very good pay video selection, very good breakfast choice of a high quality food. They even serve fresh espresso coffee. The location is also very central and offers walking distance to everything Portoroz has to offer.Just next door Kempinski opens very soon and it looks faboulous. I will be their guest when I come back, as that hotel will be the only one in the destination offering real 5star experience."
22.09.2008,3,"We stayed at this hotel as we were attending a conference, so looking for better hotel. If we had paid this price ourselves for this standard we would have been disappointed, though I do not believe there is any better in the area. The rooms are fine, quite big, clean, free internet, bath etc. I just don't think it is worth $250 AUD a night. The location is as good as can be in Portoroz - right in the centre. Yes, as another reviewer said, not much character in Portoroz - but that was expected. Only problem with hotel was that we were in sea view room which was over night dance thing in hotel that goes till very early in the morning - so it was loud. We asked to move to a quieter room, which we did, but they said none of the quieter rooms were sea view - they were mountain view. So if you are staying here I would suggest you stay in mountain view room, cheaper and no noise and just as good. We could smell smoke in the rooms, as clearly people were previously smoking in rooms. Breakfast is average - lots of variety as big hotel but feels like school camp. Overall though hotel is fine and good, I don't think there is anything better in Portoroz."
15.08.2008,5,"Me and my wife love to visit wellness centres and try different massages. This time we have decided to go to Portoroz in Slovenia, to the wellness centre in Lifeclass Hotels & Spa. We tried various treatments in Shakti Ayurveda centre where they have new therapists from India. WOW, the massages were more than great!!! We really had fun. The staff was extremely nice and you can actualy feel real Indian amtosphere! The service was excelent and you really get more for what you pay! We also tried their new renovated five-star beach and all I can say is that this is THE beach!! My wife was smiling all the time and this is definetly a good reason enough to spend our next holidays in Lifeclas!!"
30.07.2008,4,"We were originally supposed to be staying at the Hotel Marita nearby, but some building work there over-ran so Inghams very kindly moved us to the Grand instead. We were really pleased about this as we could see the facilities and reviews were much better. We arrived after dinner had finished on our first night so the hotel left us a cold buffet in our room which was a nice touch. We were also lucky enough to be given a high-floor room in the ‘tower’ block with a lovely sea view. We stayed there for 4 nights which gave us enough time to take full advantage of the indoor swimming pool complex, apart from the sauna park which we avoided due to its ‘no costumes allowed’ policy. All the public areas of the hotel are well decorated and maintained and we found the staff to be generally very helpful. We stayed there on a half board basis so ate all our meals in the hotel’s Adria restaurant. The food and service were generally very good but there was a distinct lack of labelling of the food (in any language) – vegetarians in particular should be wary of ‘hidden’ meat/fish in some of the food. The drinks in the restaurant and the hotel bar were very pricy but we struggled to find any better bars near to the hotel so we were happy to stay put in the evening. The location of the hotel is very convenient for all the attractions of Portoroz and it is a short hop to Piran which is definitely worth a visit. It’s also worth noting that there are a lot of good walks to do in and around the area – you can get maps from the tourist office.All in all, we had a really great time at this hotel - but just before we left that we discovered the cost of our room had been 300 Euros per night – so we wouldn’t go back there as it was in no way worth that much money. The formerly ruined Palace hotel next door has been taken over by the same chain and is due to open shortly so I think the Grand might face some serious competition in the future."
12.04.2008,2,"the hotel is not a 5 star , even if the 5 stars hotels in Slovenia, are not the other in the eurpoean countries.Room are small , if You are not lucky to have a new one, and not very clean, staff are very rude and they don't know at all the customers satisfaction.All the wellnes center has booked, and if you don't book one week in advance ( partciculalry the wai Thai center) are fully booked, restaurant not bad but only breakfast tasted good.In my opinion not an hotel to stay and I will never come back here again."
2.10.2007,3,"Having chosen a two centre holiday in Slovenia, our first week in Bled having been wonderful, we were a little disappointed by our reception once we reached the Grand............... The room was great once we finally got what we had booked, the food was fantastic, but our stay was slightly marred by the offhand behaviour of some of the staff! They could certainly benefit from some customer service training. The hotel itself certainly lives up to it's 5 star award with regard to cleaniness and quality of food although a little noisy at night if you chose a high floor with a sea view over the promenade."
3.09.2007,5,"In August my husband and I needed to spend several days on the Slovenian coast because of a work commitment. Believing the guidance given in a well known travel guide series, we were dismayed when we couldn't find accommodation in Piran. It was billed as perfection, while nearby Portoroz got a profile somewhere between Blackpool and Benidorm. We had to book the Grand Hotel Palace in Portoroz and braced ourselves for a less than pleasing resort experience. In fact, we ended up feeling very lucky that we'd wound up in Portoroz. Far from being nasty or brash it is in fact a great family resort with none of the expected excesses. It's spacious, green, well managed and relaxingly low key. The lovely promenade provided plenty of scope for walking. There was a good selection of quality hotels, some interesting places to eat and great swimming and sunbathing areas. The Grand Hotel Palace was worthy of its five stars, with first rate accommodation, a seafront location, superb food and one of the most impressive indoor pools complexes we'd ever seen. The Spa and Wellness Centre offered every sort of therapeutic and beauty treatment one could wish for and was reasonably priced. The staff in the hotel and in restaurants were unfailingly friendly and helpful. The impression we'd been given of this lovely holiday location was unjust and misleading and we hope to stay there again in the future."
3.09.2007,4,"Myself and my husband stayed at the Grand Hotel Palace hotel for 8 nights in August 2007. The hotel itself is beautiful, in a great location and facilities at the hotel are fantastic However I have one complaint. There are no irons in the rooms, which we were told was a safety regulation in the country. While we accept this, the hotel did not provide a room that you could do your own ironing in. We were told however that they would get a chambermaid to do it for us. We used this service on three occassions during our stay at the hotel. What the hotel did not tell us however is that they charge an exhorbinant fee for using this service. We did not realise this of course until the morning we were checking out and it appeared on our bill as"" laundry service"".. We were totally suprised at this particularly when we would have been quite willing to do our own ironing had they had a room you could do it in. It is a total rip off, try not to get caught out like we did!!"
9.06.2007,3,"Not a lot of culture in Portoroz but then that shouldn't be a surprise if you've done your research. This hotel is fine - staff are friendly, rooms are clean and functional - nothing wonderful. Didn't get time to use the wellness centre/terme..."
16.07.2006,5,"Stay at this gotel if you need a relaxing, luxurious break. The hotel has fantastic facilities including 3 indoor swimming pools, 1 outdoor shallow pool for kids and for cooling off after sunbathing on private sun terrace. I stayed half board and the food is fresh and delicious. I can fully recommend this hotel.Portoroz is the main tourist area on the slovenian coast but is still under developed which has it's own charm compared to other over developed areas such as spain.Also visit Piran for a less touristy experience."
22.03.2015,3,"From five star hotel I would expect more flawless experience, very aged room, had to ask three times to get the room sorted out for my daughter, to get her a bathrobe and slippers for visiting the pool area (we booked family room and this should already be taken care prior to our arrival), the pool complex is OK, but not amazing. Sauna park (which is not included in room price) and breakfast buffet are the only five stars experience in this hotel by my opinion."
10.03.2015,5,"I suppose that when you are paid to go to an upmarket seaside resort to work, get put up in a 5 star hotel with large comfortable rooms, an indoor swimming pool, fitness, spa with amazing massages, pretty good food (the only thing that could have been better) and efficient, friendly staff, I suppose you can't complain. So I won't. Thanks"
6.03.2015,5,"Travelling with Triplets in a five star hotel is not always easy, particulary expecting 5 Star quality for Business and pleasure. This hotel has convinced me very much. High quality dinner, breakfast, roomservice and Service. Very friendly team, cosy rooms and very clean. Nice amenities. I strongly recommend this hotel!"
15.12.2014,3,"The Hotel was ok!But the restaurant was absolutely not worth it!!Staff was very rude, did not smile and did not care about the guest!!Food was old and dry!The Rooms was a bit small, and also the shower was very smallReception was excellent!!"
26.10.2014,4,"We wanted to book directly at the hotel, but we couldn't get them, so we booked through Booking.com. But when we got there the staff was very friendly, the room was nicely furnished, food was good. We loved the piano music at dinner and the live music in the bar was very good. Some of the waiters were very young and inexperienced, but they were sweet.The room had a beautiful sea view, but there were loud parties across the street every evening."
22.10.2014,4,"The hotel is nicely situated in a central area of Portoroz with shopping experience and nice sea views.Service was very good, room clean and comfortable. The breakfast was also at good standards.However, the hotel is appreciated by tourists and you have to accommodate with sometimes noisy people."
19.08.2014,5,"Very helpful staff. Great breakfast but only stayed two nights so we didn't eat in the hotel. It is very clean, very nice room of about average size with a comfortable bed. Location is convenient, everything was within easy walking distance. The only downsize is the strength of wifi."
18.08.2014,4,"I stayed in this hotel in July with another family and 4 small children altogether. The room was very good (very nice bathroom) and maybe because it was a triple room it was quite spacious. (Could not say the same for the double room though). The hotel has super kind staff especially the reception team ( where I was impressed with their patience and the fact that they spoke ALL major foreign languages) as the check-in and out process went smoothly. The hotel has free of charge parking and a valet service available. The hotel breakfast was a superb experience with incredible variety of pastry, fresh juices, fruits, cheese etc. Make sure you take a table on the gallery as it gives somewhat better view than the ones inside. The downside is that this hotel has a regular ten days maintenance of the indoor swimming pool - in July (!). However, the guests have full access (towels included) to the pool of the adjacent hotel Slovenia that is literally 20 m away. The hotel has the best location in Portoroz - across the street from good restaurants and clubs. It has an exclusive beach with kids club and other facilities. The rooms and the hotel area were covered with good wi-fi. Unique code to be requested at the reception. (slight annoyance is that it has to be re-entered each time you get back to the hotel)."
13.08.2014,3,"Being in the area in high season, hotel is not cheap. Most rooms are tired and in need of refurbishment. You need to ask for a refurbished room to stay to get a nice room (and you will be charged extra). Having been in the hotel for several weeks, I have managed to stay on every floor and my rooms were facing in every direction my suggestions are as follows: see view is great but you also have a view of the main road which is incredibly noisy until early hours so go for higher floors if you can. Back rooms / side rooms you will trade off more quiet areas for light. Rooms facing back are relatively dark (mainly due to the near by trees). The comment about the beach, well you can pay €5 to stay there and having been there, no-one have ever checked where I was from so you may be able to go irrespective. Wifi is free but the quality will depend on your room. In some rooms the signal was very poor and would support facetime, in others, signal was ok. You will not be able to watch freeview etc. Overall, hotel is pretty average."
20.07.2014,4,"Very good all-round hotel, not too expensive for what it offers.The only downside is closed indoor swimming pool every year for 10 days in the middle of July.Excellent exclusive beach and perfect hotel location."
4.03.2015,2,"Food without any taste-yes it was just business dinner of more than 100 guests,but we still like to eat tasty food.Bier,juice,water and cola out of a red wine glass?For 4,3eur for bier?Come on I have never seen this and hopefuly will never see it again. Politeness is not their strong side.A lot of room for improvement"
22.02.2015,4,"This hotel was one of the finest in Portorož on Slovenian coast! It's on perfect location between Piran and Portorož so great holidays are guarenteed! Portorož offers great night life, night time, bars, restaurants, activities, beach, longues, casinos, playgrounds. If you take a trip to Piran, a lot of historical points, restaurants, culture, boat renting spots and much more, if you're sightseein soul! And ALL those things are close to Histrion Hotel!Histrion offers pool complex with jacuzzies, swimming-pools, water playgrounds, spas, saunas, massage spots and much more!Just take your robe and enjoy the weekend! If children are involved, there are MiniClubBilly - children spot, where you can leave your kids to play, sing karaoke or create something and have an hour or two for sauna, massage or some romantic time with your partner!Food is good; fresh, cooked fine..vegetables, fish, different meat, soups, main dished, deserts...using imagination food on your table can be awesome!Hotel aging is seen in rooms. Nothing special; mini bar, tv, bed, nice view, friendly staff..that's it!Histrion offers bunch of small shops, sightseeing spot and casino where money can be gained..or loosed ! :DSo,4 persons; 2 elders, 2 kids; girls enjoyed swimming, playing, creating, singing karaokes, showing their talents on evening show, magician evening show and much more!Rooms in the hotel are connected with the pool and spa area, restaurants, casino, gift shop, a la cart restaurant and...boat yard!Deffinitly recommending!"
30.11.2014,4,"I stayed here for a night when attending a conference at the Bernardin Grand. The hotel has a prime location, the view is amazing and the ""grander"" hotel is a short walk away (the drive, on the other hand, is so convoluted that it actually takes you longer to get there by car). The remains of a 15th century monastery in the courtyard are an unusual sight, but they do detract from the tackiness of the nearby casino. The decor is a bit loud, what with the stark contrast of the dark blues and the cherry-toned woods, but I get it, it has a maritime theme, whatever. The hotel itself is clean, though some of the furnishings in the common areas are showing signs of age. The hotel does look much nicer from the outside. The rooms don't feel cramped and the bathrooms are decent. I only have one gripe with them and that is the distance of the TP holder from the actual lavatory seat. I hate having to get up to reach the damn wiping paper and there is literally nowhere closer to put :) The balconies are fitted with standard plastic lawn furniture and there are some lights that come on automatically in the dusk which might bother some people. Later at night I found them turned off, though I couldn't locate the switch myself. Worth checking into, so you don't have to resort to hanging a pair of undies over it like my friend did when you fancy a pre-dinner nap :)TV gets some international channels but I preferred looking through the window. Spring the extra 20€ for the sea view, it is worth it. The regular prices are kind of insane but there are always some amazing deals available. My stay was comped by the organizers but when my parents stayed here they paid less for a 3-night weekend than the regular price is per night. Check with your travel agent. The restaurant is large enough, at least off season. The breakfast selection is a pretty standard continental deal, no complaints there. Unlike most of the 4* hotels, there is an ample number of coffee machines for the caffeine-dependent. Big plus there. Due to my short stay I couldn't make full use of the amenities, but the pool looks nice from the outside. Off-season nightlife is quite crippled. There is a free bus to take you to Piran from the nearby parking lot, but on that 2km stretch of road we counted maybe three bars that weren't closed ON A FRIDAY NIGHT! If you want a beer before bedtime, you're confined to the hotel bar."
27.10.2014,4,Portoroz is cool. Also the hotel is on very nice location with perfect view on the see. The rooms are confortable and clean but the it will need renovation in a future. But otherwise reasonable price for the room.
27.10.2014,3,"Name of the hotel changed, but everything else stays practically the same. Hotel itself is in good condition. Our connected room was clean with the seaview. Breakfast was rich, really difficult to imagine what could be added. Price was a little to high, but considering that the entrance to the pool area and free parking were included, then ok. TV set in the room was rather small, no more then 20"".Pool area definitely needs renovation, especially changing rooms, please don't look toward ceiling. With very few exertion larger pool can look as new. Please try to avoid weekend and Slovenian Holidays if visiting the pools."
29.09.2014,4,"Stayed here about a week to attend the convention at Grand Bernardin. Room is clean and sunset from the room was beautiful. My room was with bath tub which I enjoyed. Two problems, one is room key to too bulky and heavy. Another one is stairs. Even if you take elevator, you have to go through steps. A car or bus cannot enter in front of Histrion, so you need to get off at in front of its sister hotel, Vile Park. On the way, we carried heavy suitscase at stairs through Vile Park front. On returned, we realized that there was slope in between buidlings and carried up our suitcase. It was surprise for me to have many stairs although most of guests were seniors. Basic amenities of soup, shampoo, and shower cap.Noise level was variable depending on where your room was. If near patio, some music at night time. Souvenior shop at Histrion was pretty nice. You can also walk to histric town of Piran."
11.09.2014,4,"Hotel with nice rooms and A/C. Located near sea with own swimming pools.Restaurant was providing very nice staff and good meals. Despite plenty of people there was never shortage.Evening summer program lasted normally until 11pm, which is a good ratio between people which want to sleep and those which want to stay up a bit longer."
30.08.2014,3,"Hotel is situated by the sea, quiet location of Portorož. It is 25 minute walk to Portorož promenade or 35 minutes walk to beautiful town Piran. Other possibility is to take train which operates from Piran to Portoroz and back via Historion hotel. The ticket costs 4€.Rooms in Historion hotels are nice, comfortable and clean. Our room was on the fird floor orientated to inner side. But it did not matter as there is small port for motor boats.nice look, no bad smells. It is quiet hotel. We had halfboard during our stay. Plenty of various dishes. Dinners vary from night to night. At least 6 different dishes to be choosen from. Vegetables, fruits, cakes or icecream as well. Halfboard runs selfservice. Breakfast is selfservice as well, european style of breakfast. Plenty of choices. They have great croissants. Freshly baked,. Yummy.No worries of too many people being in the restaurant at the same time. The staff walks around taking care of people. Serving drinks, preparing tables and most important putting more food out, ongoing. We never experienced no food left. If there is empty space, in a while it is filled again.Access to the sea is more suitable for young people as it is pool stair. There is grass area available. I prefered the access to the sea in Portorož promenade. There are more public beaches as well. I saw only one with the sand. Umbrellas and chairs for rent are available."
22.07.2014,4,"I stayed in this hotel in May 2014. The location is perfect, next to the sea and very close to Piran. However, Portoroz is cca 20 min away by foot. Food was good, especially breakfast, varity of fresh fruit, different bread and everything you need. Stuff is really helpful and kind. The downsite is the bathroom which looks old and cheap, but on the other hand It is very clean. I must say that hotel is quite big and it could be a bit timeconsuming if you go forget sth in the room, because halls are really long...but its good for your healt."
29.06.2014,5,"Great food quality,varietyLovely views. Friendly service.Clean accommodations. Large pools and whirlpool.Casino.Boardwalk to charming seaside city of Piran.Easy transport to Portoroz.Lively city with restaurants, casino and night life."
23.05.2014,4,"Clean and comfortable hotel. Our room 255 had a view from the balcony over the boats tied up outside . We were there in May dso it was quiet. You need to unload your bags 100 mtrs from the hotel, Location is lovely on the water, bathrooms and bedrooms were clean. I would go back. I didn't get a chance to use the spa/pool as we were on a tour"
25.12.2013,4,"I only stayed one night at the hotel.The room and the bathroom were clean but nothing special. Except for the view that was amazing. When I got there there were no space to park the car in fornt of the hotel. I had to leave the car in the main street and run to the reception (about 100m), give 20€ deposit for the parking card and then i was able to park in the garage for free which is great but I still had to walk with my luggage to the hotel. Other than that everything else was OK."
29.09.2013,3,"Older hotel in a great area...located directly on the Adriatic Sea. cafeteria style buffet restaurant, very noisy and poor food..poor quality wine as well. Nice pool area with slide. Only 3 floors so for a large hotel some rooms were located very far down the hallways and took forever. Lobby and adjacent outdoors area overlooking the sea was excellent. All rooms had a balcony all with nice views. Beds were extremely soft..should be updated but clean.. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Wifi available for 2 euros a day."
21.09.2013,3,"Hotel was build in 80', but this seems not the be the biggest problem. Rooms are OK, sea view is spectacular, location is the best in Portorož. The most disappointing was food. There is a big choice of food, but the taste of it is not as you would expect for this kind of hotel (4 star). All is based on lot's of oil, greasy souses, overcooked pasta... I think the hotel will have to bring the food on higher level. Means more tasty and also healthier. Otherwise...I can't complain about the stay there and the personal is super nice.The only thing what I was missing was the gym. Guests are allowed to use the gym from Grand Hotel Bernardin (next door), but it only opens at 9am, which is pretty late for a gym."
9.07.2013,3,"Its a huge complex actually being closer to Piran than ""Downtown Portoroz"". 4star is a very bold exaggeration, We had one ""suite"" for ourselves and a room for the kids. Carpets throughout extremely worn and stained, Mattresses definitely have reached the end of any acceptable life-span. Bathrooms very tiny but fairly clean. The entire place smells as if there was lots of dust hanging in the air everywhere.Access to the Hotel by car is rather difficult and you can not drive up to the reception. Porters (if in sight) make up for this. Parking is for free on a ""pay-lot"" just outside the Hotel, but which does not offer any shade for the car and is open to the public so especially on weekends it does get crowded by locals. The view from the rooms is nice, but if you like to hear the waves splashing during the night insist on a room facing the open sea and not the bay of Portoroz! Incredible Disco-Noise would keep you up all night coming from the many Establishments lining the bay of Portoroz. (For the very same reason I am truly happy NOT to have booked a room actually IN Portoroz! The noise there must be unbearable! Taverna Mediteran as a part of the Hotel: 2 servings of Chicken Nuggets for Kids, 1 (rather disgusting looking) Spaghetti Bolognese (Kids size), 2 Bottles of plain water, 1 Coke, 1 Espresso.... € 50,- ???? WTF?!Staff, especially what seemed to be the Front Desk Manager, VERY friendly!Breakfast: Try to be there (Buffet Style) at 7:00 when it opens. The type of clientele obviously attracted to this Hotel will quickly make a disgusting ""war zone"" of it - despite the desperate efforts of the staff!Speaking of ""clientele"": When going there, keep in mind that it is very close to Austria and consequently very easy (and cheap!) for not exactly the ""Austrian Upper Class"" to reach for some vacation at the sea. All in all the place has a the strange charm of the Hotels typical for the bygone era of ""Tito Socialism"". I am pretty sure that package deals with full board when booked ahead in a travel agency would cost way less for a full week than what we paid, rack-rate on the Internet for 2 nights with breakfast. But so be it, strangely enough we did enjoy the 2 nights, the sea seemed clean and clear and the large concrete slab substituting ""beach"" is just the way it is in this area."
20.05.2013,3,"I spent a long weekend with my family in the hotel. Stayed in an apartment room with sea view. I think the hotel needs some renewal, maybe it was 4star quality 5-7 years ago, but today it a 3 minus... Worn carpet, uncomfortable bed. However the wellness area is great: pools with salty water, pools for children etc, this part is highly recommended. The area is quiet, for a strange reason the lights on the balcony can not be switched off from the room, but they switch them off centrally at 22.30. This was a bit embarassing, when our child gone to bed at 9.30 and could not sleep cis if the lightAll in all: Ok for a short stay, but do not expect high comfort."
4.09.2012,2,"We went to this hotel as nearby Grand Hotel Bernardin was fully booked, and the location is actually very good - close to the nice Piran town, and not far from Portoroz. But that turns to be the only plus of the hotel.Having read some reviews and trying to make some safety cushion we went for studio type of room, hoping and will be better. Alas, it was only bigger. Room design is a marvel to behold if you're into weird things. Had 2 bathrooms, one extremely narrow, and one extremely big (it had a toilet and a set of bathing things like shampoo or head cap, but no sight of shower). Furniture is old and weary, and carpet on the floor had plenty of dirty spots from previous visitors. No things like slippers or robe. A safe, small enough to hardly accomodate an iPad, if you're travelling with something bigger (maybe a laptop?) - it won't fit in. Balconies had lamps, but we failed to figure how to switch them on.Hotel itself is another designer's masterpiece, if you manage to get the room numbered in x80s-x90s you're bound to have a very long walk from the entrance to your room.Breakfast is not impressive at all, same things every day, and not very tempting too, good thing there are a lot of good places to have dinners and you could settle just for some light snack.Hotel personnel seemed to be playing the ""I don't see you"" game, we were hardly getting any welcoming words or smiles, they preferred to instantly turn away once catching your sight on them. The only person who could not avoid that was the guy on reception, he maybe even greeted us once in a week time.Hotel ""beach"" is something we went to check once, it has only staired entrances into the sea, so if you're not a good swimmer (like my wife) this place is not for you. Instead we went to nearby Grand Hotel Bernardin beach, which you can use either for free withour having a deck-chair and umbrella (because, frankly, in Slovenia sea cannot be privately owned and thus no access restrictions can apply), or with those things for a fee.All in all, a very badly maintained hotel, not a place we will return to by any means."
23.10.2011,4,"This year was our second stay at the hotel Historian, great hotel. We came twice, with no room reservation, the staff at the reception was wonderful they always find rooms for us at the hotel. We will return next year again.The only thing I would not recommend is the garden restaurant at the Hotel Historian down stars, service was terrible, waiters didn't care, we waited for our drinks for about twenty minutes , we asked if they can bring us our drinks. The waiter told us we are not the only ones waiting. After that I was even more shocked the waiter and the Manager started to make fun of us , ""Stupid American, Those Idiots, Who do they think they are, They can stay home if they don't like it here,"" They didn't know that I understood Slovenian. So I do recommend the hotel , not the garden restaurant. In Portoroz they have great restaurants with great service."
8.08.2011,4,A good time to be there! Also al the different things are verry well. The Beach is at the Sunnysite of this Hotel with friendly people around all the time. Near of this Hotel is the beautiful village PIRAN.
25.06.2010,5,"We have been visiting this hotel for about 20 years now, and can recommend it very highly. It is visually stunning, located on a beautiful stretch of coastline about 1 mile south of the charming old town of Piran that can be easily reached by following a coastal promenade past the lovely harbour of Piran, and a similar distance from the resort of Portoroz. The hotel is well kept and the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are several restaurants in and around the hotel and the food is always excellent and reasonably priced. The hotel is quiet and popular with both both couples and families. The one drawback [for some] might be that there is little in the the way of entertainment or sports facilities, althought there is an indoor pool and tennis courts."
4.03.2015,2,"Food without any taste-yes it was just business dinner of more than 100 guests,but we still like to eat tasty food.Bier,juice,water and cola out of a red wine glass?For 4,3eur for bier?Come on I have never seen this and hopefuly will never see it again.

2.03.2015,4,"Asking around for a good thermal spa resort we were advised to try Terme Catez. This was not an easy decision to go as it is a four hour drive from our house, but as we received good reviews we decided to try it out. After a long Friday evening drive we arrived at the hotel and were not disappointed,, the room we had was excellent, large and the bed very comfortable. The hotel was nice,, staff friendly,, and meals acceptable good for a buffet selection. Thermal Spa was good, massage excellent,, all in all a very good experience.. Well worth the long drive to get there,,"
15.02.2015,4,"We spent 10 days in Terme Catez over Christmas and New Year holidays and it was our first time to stay in this hotel. We really enjoyed staying here as the accommodation was very comfortable, food was great and our hosts were simple wonderful! We were also very tired and awaited for this break with great impatience. So, the fact that all was really nice, made our holidays even better!The location of the Spa is also very good, as you can go in couple of hours and visit other places in Slovenia (Ljubljana, Celje,...) or in Croatia (Zagreb,..). The hotel has a nice spa facility that we used most of the time, although we also had a possibility to go on a daily basis to the big spa complex. We did not use much of spa complex as it was holidays and it was a bit overcrowded and noisy, but if you have children, for sure they will enjoy this big spa complex, since lots of possibilities for fun. So, your kids will be very happy and probably very tired in the evening after enjoying the whole day swimming and jumping in this swimming pool complex. You can also use several massage options, including the royal thai massage. However, I would suggest that you use the massage centre of the hotel, as they are professional physiotherapists and for sure know well how to do massage. You can also use Sauna and other possibilities in the hotel, but these are subject (as well as massage) to charges. Hotel will offer variety of packages, so for sure you will find something that suits you well.Our room was on the forth floor. It was very clean, bright and very warm. Room and bathroom are big in size and for sure, you will find everything that may be needed for a pleasant stay. Our housekeeper was lovely and took very good care of us. We booked queen-size bad and it was the best option for our stay.If you are going to spa, you can bring your bath robe. You can get one in the hotel, but you will be charged for it. Also, if you order bath robe, most probably it will be automatically changed every day, and you will be charged for that day, even if you do not use it. You need to indicate in advance at the reception if you do not want bath robe for some day, so it is not charged to your account.We had booked accommodation with breakfast and dinner. It was really the best option as meals are organized on the base of the Swedish table, so you have huge variety of everything. No way, you would stay hungry here!Wi-Fi connection was the best in the lobby/caffe bar area. In room, signal could be very week if many users (hotel was full during winter holidays). But, this should not spoil your holidays, as in case of need, you can take your coffee in the bar and check your mail.With our big thanks to Ms Vesna and her team. We are very grateful for your warm and friendly hospitality."
11.02.2015,4,"Comfortable and with an interesting decor. Very good service and hospitality. Great swimming pool and wellness centre. Should be a lot better during spring or summer.The wifi needs some improvement, it was low signal and crashing frequently.Definitely a place to go back."
20.12.2014,5,The room was very modern and clean. Friendly staff. Good food. Swimm-pool and saunas are big. Located near the Aqua park. Wi-fee free and fast. Free parking for the car. Fitness area also. I will visit it again.

11.11.2014,3,"The room I got (no balcony) was very modern, cosy and clean at the first sight. Deeper look disclosed flys in the ceiling lights, dirty windows, pipe green rust in the bathroom. Such not really important things that ruin the big picture however. Wi-fi was poor constantly crashing. Pool area needs renovation. Attitude of reception staff poor."
16.10.2014,5,A great experience. Hygiene great. Staff friendly and always at your service. Great choice of delicious food. Objection would be ill-equipped fitness room with old machines.Rooms spacious and very comfortable.
3.10.2014,4,"Attended a two day conference held at this hotel. Very pleasantly surprised to find the hotel was brimming with high quality pool and spa and very friendly and helpful staff.

We were there from September 5th til September 12th, 2014 and we had half board meal package plan.Upon arrival at the hotel we were given a room straight away, as well as directions as to how to get cards for Thermal Riviera, working hours of the pools and the restaurants and many other things. The rooms at this hotel are big, bright and clean. Bathroom is also of a great size. The chambermaid made our beds every day and she changed our towels whenever we threw our previous ones on the floor (that's the hotel's policy). On our 6th day she even changed our bathrobes as well as the bedclothes (our sheets, pillowcases and blankets). I was only disappointed with the condition of the fitted carpet as it had a lot of stains.Both breakfast and dinner were buffet meals. At breakfast, typical food was offered, but there was something for everyone. At dinner, you could choose various types of meat, fish and pasta, as well as potatoes, rice, cooked or raw vegetables, salads, cheese pies and so on. There was a huge table for fruit only where you could find apple, bananas, plums, grapes, pineapple, kiwi, peaches, etc. Also, in the corner you could find different cakes and three different ice cream flavours and fruit mixes from a can. The cakes were mostly okay, but the fruit tartlet (mini tart) was amazing and banana covered with chocolate and red berries sauce was also good.Prices of the drinks offered at dinner were revoltingly high. For example, 0.5l of water was around 2.5€.The pools at hotel Terme are really good, and I loved the water, but my mum considered it to be a bit too warm. The pools at hotel Catez were of a bit more appropriate temperature for my mum though. It was raining most of the time we spent there, so we were compelled to spend it in the inside pools and the Winter Thermal Riviera. However, we did have two days of summer weather which we deliberately spent at the Summer Thermal Riviera.The Rivieras are amazing, the pools are great as well as the water temperature and the slides, and not at all outdated, as several reviewers have previously stated. Terme Catez is only 7km from the Slovenian/Croatia border and 4km from the nearest town, Brezice, which is a typical Slovenian small town. We visited the town on a Saturday, and the one-way ticket is 1.80€ per person.Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, is 30km away.All the staff is pleasant and will help you with anything if you ask them to (except for the woman who works at the Post Office).It'd be perfect if this hotel accepted dogs (and not for 20€/night like the annex of hotel Toplice does - it'd be acceptable if for that money the dog had its own bed, as well as meal plan).We enjoyed this stay, and we will definitely come again."
1.09.2014,4,"we were two time before at Terme Catez but in other hotel, in hotel Toplice. This time I was with my husbantandwe wanted little more exclusive vocation so we rent apatrman. It was very nice. Generaly, all Terme are very nice. Pools aregreat, but I think that is forfamily with kids, notjust adults. Although it was fun for as too. there are some slides and pools for adults. only the night life is poor. food is more than great. near the hotel is few little charming towns where were some nice restaurants."
21.08.2014,3,"Terme is one of the many hotels in the Cateske toplice complex. The room are spacious and well designed. I especially liked the bathroom. Generally, the hotel is very clean. A careful examination however shows that a light coloured carpet is full of stains. The staff is friendly and willing to help.The buffet food is OK, there is a lot of choice, but the food is not very innovative and it tries to please the average Slovenian taste. The meat is heavily overcooked, steamed (also overcooked) vegetables were probably bought frozen in one of the supermarkets, the choice of salads is rather poor and the choice of sweets is limited to the most generic hotel cakes possible. The price for a buffet dinner is 18 EUR. Also, the prices of drinks are excessive. For example, 1/2 litre of still water costs 2.5 EUR and a small glass (1 dl) of home wine costs 2.4 EUR.You can enjoy a free entry into the pool/sauna/fitness complex. I only visited the saunas. There are only three of them and the complex seems well kept if a bit tired. It somehow fails to provide an enjoyable spa experience.I also visited the large spa complex called Termalna riviera. As a hotel guest I had to pay additional 10 EUR. There are many saunas and pools, the place is well kept, but, this complex is even more tired and desperately calls for a serious renovation. It somehow represents a typical Eastern European vision of the spa from 1980s. Bottom line: I think that Cateske toplice may be an excellent choice for a family with small children. But, for a typical spa relaxation look elsewhere."
19.08.2014,5,"Great time at the hotel, health club, swimming pool with special water. Staff are great. Good food. Excellent location for a relaxing holiday and refreshing powers. Comfortable and spacious rooms.Fair prices"
14.05.2014,5,"Hotel is great! Pool for kids is ideal and would recommend to families with kids! The pool are big and there are 1 million things to do to keep the kids occupied and the parents relaxed. Food is good and prices are reasonable. 3 days is a good timespan to stay, anything more is a lot..."
7.05.2014,3,"Just came from Èatež. The hotel is nice, renovated rooms are cool, staff is unpolite and breakfasts and dinners are poor. They could have done this much better. I guess they were tired becouse of the hurry between holidays, but still .."
7.04.2014,4,"We've stayed 2 nights in Hotel Tereme (end of March). The room was nice, comfortable and quite big. Nice and spacious bathroom too. Good choice of food for all meals + kind staff. Poor internet conection. Except spa activities, there's not really much to do. Two days is more than enough and even though we’ve had a nice time and relaxing weekend, I have to say I wouldn’t return again."
16.03.2014,4,"very good but the only complaint is really desperate internet in the rooms, as a 4 Stars must fix. otherwise the pool is also a great food. our little 5 years enjoyed all 5 days spent there.there, what makes this place so attractive is winter thermal area with lots of slides which is great if you have kids"
25.02.2014,5,"Hotel is located 100m from the aquapark (Termal riviera) entrance. Parking space is in front of the hotel. The hotel staff is friendly and polite. Rooms and bathrooms are modern equipped, clean and spacious. Very good choice of very tasty food. Both indoor and outdoor pools, and saunas are great and not overcrowded."
13.02.2014,5,"We visit this hotel every 3 months for a quick rehab. Rooms are renovated and modern, food is great and pool is great because is it never overcrowded (with nice warm water).Suggestion to everybody who wants a fresh restart!"
5.01.2014,3,"After four hours drive from Belgrade, we have arrived to the Hotel. Check in lasted for one whole hour, which is horrible. We finally settled in our room, which is the only good thing. The rooms are great... Went to the Thermal Riviera which was too crowded for my taste and didn't enjoy it at all. Came there to enjoy water and spa and didn't at all. The jacuzzi in Hotel is a shame, rusty which is something this hotel cannot afford (4 star hotel). Generally disappointed."
19.10.2013,5,"We enjoyed the hotel vrey much. First thing: The rooms are very convenient and bath rooms too..Second thing: The food is good. Third thing: The service is excellent.One thing is a little unconvenient,there is no publical transport if you want to visit places. the solution can be only if you order a taxi or you rent a car. otherwise the place is perfectm"
13.09.2013,4,"Four times I have stayed in this hotel, the hotel rooms are definitely with four stars, which can not be said for the hotel lobby and the dining room.It's great for a weekend, two nights three days of swimming in pools .. and the use of all programs offered by the spa ...Breakfast is very correct and most picky will find what suits them, dinner is 18 euros per person, a little stronger price,but will satisfy every taste.We were in a room on the fourth floor and the wifi signal was unreliable.Parking is free of charge.Advice for travelers coming from Serbia do not buy a vignette for Slovenia, because the spa is very close to the border, and there is a local route if you want to avoid the highway (border - spa 5 km)."
7.09.2013,3,The hotel was built in the 70's and has not had much work since then. The showers are so small that you will have a hard time cleaning yourself. I stayed for 4night and the did not do a good cleaning job once. Staff was nice but distant. Pool area and spa average at best.
16.08.2013,2,"The staff, food & facilities in the hotel were all disappointing and not what one would expect from a 4 star hotel, or maybe they were in the 80's in communist country.. Wifi did not work in the room and cable connection is very slow, food at breakfast was poor and the ""organic""holds a bawl of oatmeal and 2 kinds of jams. The shower (balcony room) is tiny, However the indoors & out door water park are great - so if you get a reasonable price it might be worth going."
6.08.2013,5,"We had a most wonderful holiday in this hotel. This hotel is situated in a picturesque surrounding. The rooms are clean and spacious, the food in the hotel is great. My 6 year old had enjoyed himself thoroughly, there is a huge complex of indoors/outdoors swimming pools. In the evenings there is a children entertainment. Highly recommend for families with small children. I loved the sauna/steam room in our hotel. Would definitely come back again."
5.08.2013,5,"It is a long time since I booked a 4 star hotel and I get a 5 stars! Really , this hotel is offerering more than a lot of 5 stars hotel were I have been. The hotel is new , excellent furniture , very clean , very friendly staff ( I had a flat tire and they did an a very good job finding me a car service even on Saturday ). The hotel is basically in a Thermal Facility with excellent hot water. In the price of the room was also included the ticket for the AQUAPARK.We have really enjoyed."
16.05.2013,4,"We stayed for a week, the superior rooms are very nice and clean,bathrobes are included, the nature soroundings are wonderfull, the air is crisp and fresh. I would say it is a standard 4 star hotel, the staff is nice and welcoming. The food is good, (breakfast is repetitive though, it would be nice if they changed it sometimes, it was completely the same for 7 days). The spa facilities are also very good. The only thing that needs improvement in my opinion is the card system - you use the room key card to enter the hotel spa and pool so you have to carry it around all the time in your bathrobe. It would be better if they had bracelets so you would not have to worry about losing the card all the time (or having the right one if you are in a group like we were)."
15.04.2013,3,"Great potential but ... renovated rooms are really beautiful, we stayed in double room superior with balcony. The only bad thing about the room is heating. We had 28,9°C in the room and we asked the receptionist for help-3 times!!!! We were told twice that the problem is fixed but .... it wasnt. So we left opened window all night long and in the morning the temperature was 26,8 °C... There could also be an ashtray on the balcony. FOOD- average. Staff in the dinning room and life guard on the hotel pool were nice, staff on the reception- catastrophic.Hotel pool is clean and very peaceful. A nice surprise was a daily newspaper in the room."
8.04.2013,5,"Hotel is nice, renovated. Very comfortable bad, spacy room, all is very clean. Easy access to the swimming pool and saunas, offer of many types of massages - I had been enjoyed one excellent! Spa center has good offer, it's clean but the ambient could be nicer. Also they are organizing animation at the evening but I didn't visit it, I heard it was very funny (stand up comedy was that night). Practically no need to leave the hotel. Free entrance to Winter riviera whit nice bubble pool and jacuzzi but if you want just ti relax it's not good choice because of huge noise. Mostly is visited by families with kids and for them is great. Breakfast in hotel is rich (salty, sweet,fruits, healthy....for all tastes). Definitely to be visited again."
20.03.2013,4,"It was very beautiful experiences, for us and for kids. Most of the time we spent on the swimming pool terraces. Swimming pools are very clean and also have a lot's of different things for kids and grown. Restaurant is in very beautiful sorrounding, to enjoy the meal."
11.03.2013,4,Terme is a perfect place when you have 3-5 days. For families is very good to book a small houses with two bedrooms and a living room. Great position to explore Slovenia too. Nice castles you may find in near Mokrice and Brezice. Ljubljana is just 1 hour drive from there.
7.02.2013,3,"We stayed in the apartment hotel. Rooms are basically equipped, furniture is cheap and worn out. TV was supposed to be flat screen; it was some old and tiny one (not flat screen). Staff has zero interest in guest. I have complained that there is no internet connection (which they said they have, and I need it). The answer was:* day 1: ""I'm sorry, I don't have the key from the router room to reset it, but I'll do it first thing in the morning""* day 2: nobody answers the phone at reception* day 3: ""but we have wifi here, in reception."" (1 km away). Well, I’m glad they had internet in reception. I didn’t.pool facilities, however, are very good. great place to go with kids, even in winter time.Would I go again? to the Therme yes, for sure. to the appartments? no, for sure. much better to find a better and cheaper hotel / appartment nearby, and to pay for use of the Therme."
25.01.2013,4,"Hotel Terme is very good hotel located in Catez, Slovenija. Service is pleasant and friendly. Rooms are good size and clean. Food in Hotel is very good. Wellness is perfecet in Hotel and Terme Catez Water park. Place to relax and realy enjoy"
18.08.2012,3,"Rooms were redecorated in 2011, and they are equipped with modern and stylish furniture, new TV system and efficient A/C. They are also just about the right size, so we felt comfortable. This is probably the strongest point here. They have issues with staff there. Even the smallest request ended up in endless ""discussion"" with receptionists. Attitude problem. Don't expect to be greeted when you are passing by reception, they rather turn their heads down and pretend to be busy. Also, sign ""do not disturb"" you leave on your door doesn't mean anything - cleaning staff will enter your room no matter what. Eco-thinking and 'replace only towels on the floor' also mean nothing.Staff in the restaurant is somewhat better, especially the more experienced (read: older) ones. Remark: don't expect to get plain tap water there - ""not allowed"", I was told by waiter - and expect to pay for bottle of plain water. Reasonable or not, you be the judge.Breakfast and dinner are buffet-type. Quality- wise nothing to write home about, but at least you have a selection to choose from. Breakfast was little dull - same stuff every morning.Internet access is poor - 1 MB/s in 2012. is considered poor. Apart from that, annoying repetitive prompt to log on (vs. staying connected) is a bad choice from hotel's IT staff.To conclude: we enjoyed our rooms, but communication with staff was mainly hassle. Large (and usually loud) groups of Italian guests during the month of August is something you might want to avoid. We do recommend this hotel, as the best of three hotels in Terme Catez."
30.09.2011,5,"2 of us stayed at Terme hotel for 1 night, room was very nice furnitured, renovated one, pools were relaxing so as sauna and jakuzzi, place Èatež is one to stay max 3 days, but if u need short rest in calm, clean and warm atmosfered place u are at right place.There is a big water park for children.The thing with hotel Terme is that just guests of this hotel can use pools of this hotel."
31.08.2011,4,"We were in Terme Catez by the end of August.It was fantastistik...What I expected for a journey of 5 day(advertised as ""mini odmor"" or ""mini holiday"") turned to be the best thing this summer for us.Hotel Terme is recently renovated so the rooms a very nice with a descent equipment.The dining room is ok and the dishes are""to die for them""...in 5 day never the same.Hotel Terme deserve all 4 stars that are given...The indoor and out door swiming pools are perfect.Everyday at 15.00 the stuff provided to gests the basket full with apples and oranges.Mmmm...Very relaxing while you enjoy the warm wather in pools(it is thermal wather-33 to 43 C).About reception stuff...very nice and kind...The best I have ever meet at hotels.My best regards for them.We were the only turists from Macedonia and they really try hard to help us about everything....About Winther riviera-perfect,clean and warm...The best I have ever been to...About Summer Riviera-dissapointment....very dirty.There were too many people that lay on the grass around the pools and when they get in, they took the grass on the foot inside the pools...so everything looks dirty...Beter organisation for next summer."
22.08.2011,3,"During a check in we wanted to pay the bill in advance, the receptionist was very unprofessional, unpolite and very suprised about our request. Her attitude was like "" is it time to do it now "" !!!!I have tried also to get information for late check out, i have asked 3 times on a reception.Each time i got information "" Please come tommorow""Restaurant staff were also unpolite und looked very tired.Anyway hotel is ok but no quality for 4* hotel and service is very very bed.I'm not sure that we shall visit this hotel anymore."
14.08.2011,2,We stayed a Terme Catez appartments for 3 days. In the first appartment we did not have hot water and following long minutes of discussions with the on call manager we needed to move to another one. Both appartments were not clean. The suparmarket is very expensive and it is recommended to buy things in the near village.
5.08.2011,5,"If you are looking for a good place to spend your weekend, to relax in the termal pools,go to Terme Catez in Slovenia. Catez is a village near the border with Croatia,only 400 kms far from my town Belgrade. There are two big Termal rivieras (one open, one closed) with many swimming-pools, stream river, rain tree, jacuzzi, etc.I stayed in the Catez hotel, which is very nice and clean, the staff is very polite andfriendly. If you like to be close to the countryside, you can stay in a campsite or in the Indian village (also in Catez). The trip you wil never forget."
26.04.2011,5,"We have been to quite a few wellness spas in Slovenia but Terme Catez is definitely something special. Apartments are very nice, modern, with spacious rooms. The restaurants served excellent breakfast and good dinner. Wellness and spa centers are the best part of the Catez. They are huge, the saunas are very clean and spacious. Unforgettable. The swimming pools are also unique, you can swim in indoor and outdoor pools or even enjoy real waves in a special section. The staff is extremely helpful, all demands are responded to with a smile, you really feel welcome. Wonderfull Pirate's bay is a drop away from the Indian village, Summer Thermal Riviera and Apartment village. It is an ideal place to spend an unforgetable vacation with family, in couple or for team building programmes. I''ll be back !!!!"
26.04.2011,3,"We spent one night in April, since it was Easter and we had no reservation all the hotels ( Hotel Toplice ****, Hotel Terme **** Hotel Catez *** ) and Apartments were fully booked. We stayed in the camping, Pirates Bay Bungalow: a series of wooden-type floating bungalows over a small artificial pond . Clean and basic, bed linen included,there's a kitchenette ,small dining room and a lake-view terrace .no bathroom ( and no running water ), you can use camping facilities ( wc-showers-washes ) .Not very cheap 130euro ( each bungalow can accomodate up to 5persons : one kingsize bed + one addittional single bed downstairs and a two persons bed in the garret ) with free entrance for bathing at Thermal Riviera ( outdoor and indoor waterpark, extra pay for to enter the Sauna Park ). Free parking. Expensive cafe -restaurants and minimarket, buy your own food outside the thermal park."
2.03.2015,4,"Asking around for a good thermal spa resort we were advised to try Terme Catez. This was not an easy decision to go as it is a four hour drive from our house, but as we received good reviews we decided to try it out. After a long Friday evening drive we arrived at the hotel and were not disappointed,, the room we had was excellent, large and the bed very comfortable. The hotel was nice,, staff friendly,, and meals acceptable good for a buffet selection. Thermal Spa was good, massage excellent,, all in all a very good experience.. Well worth the long drive to get there,,"
15.02.2015,4,"We spent 10 days in Terme Catez over Christmas and New Year holidays and it was our first time to stay in this hotel. We really enjoyed staying here as the accommodation was very comfortable, food was great and our hosts were simple wonderful! We were also very tired and awaited for this break with great impatience. So, the fact that all was really nice, made our holidays even better!The location of the Spa is also very good, as you can go in couple of hours and visit other places in Slovenia (Ljubljana, Celje,...) or in Croatia (Zagreb,..). The hotel has a nice spa facility that we used most of the time, although we also had a possibility to go on a daily basis to the big spa complex. We did not use much of spa complex as it was holidays and it was a bit overcrowded and noisy, but if you have children, for sure they will enjoy this big spa complex, since lots of possibilities for fun. So, your kids will be very happy and probably very tired in the evening after enjoying the whole day swimming and jumping in this swimming pool complex. You can also use several massage options, including the royal thai massage. However, I would suggest that you use the massage centre of the hotel, as they are professional physiotherapists and for sure know well how to do massage. You can also use Sauna and other possibilities in the hotel, but these are subject (as well as massage) to charges. Hotel will offer variety of packages, so for sure you will find something that suits you well.Our room was on the forth floor. It was very clean, bright and very warm. Room and bathroom are big in size and for sure, you will find everything that may be needed for a pleasant stay. Our housekeeper was lovely and took very good care of us. We booked queen-size bad and it was the best option for our stay.If you are going to spa, you can bring your bath robe. You can get one in the hotel, but you will be charged for it. Also, if you order bath robe, most probably it will be automatically changed every day, and you will be charged for that day, even if you do not use it. You need to indicate in advance at the reception if you do not want bath robe for some day, so it is not charged to your account.We had booked accommodation with breakfast and dinner. It was really the best option as meals are organized on the base of the Swedish table, so you have huge variety of everything. No way, you would stay hungry here!Wi-Fi connection was the best in the lobby/caffe bar area. In room, signal could be very week if many users (hotel was full during winter holidays). But, this should not spoil your holidays, as in case of need, you can take your coffee in the bar and check your mail.With our big thanks to Ms Vesna and her team. We are very grateful for your warm and friendly hospitality."
11.02.2015,4,"Comfortable and with an interesting decor. Very good service and hospitality. Great swimming pool and wellness centre. Should be a lot better during spring or summer.The wifi needs some improvement, it was low signal and crashing frequently.Definitely a place to go back."
20.12.2014,5,The room was very modern and clean. Friendly staff. Good food. Swimm-pool and saunas are big. Located near the Aqua park. Wi-fee free and fast. Free parking for the car. Fitness area also. I will visit it again.
12.12.2014,4,"Great Rooms, good Breakfast and dinner Buffet. Very good level service. Swim-pool, sauna and massage with a good price and professional quality.Well located just in front Acqua Park.2 Different Restaurants and a Bar..Very good value for money..."
11.11.2014,3,"The room I got (no balcony) was very modern, cosy and clean at the first sight. Deeper look disclosed flys in the ceiling lights, dirty windows, pipe green rust in the bathroom. Such not really important things that ruin the big picture however. Wi-fi was poor constantly crashing. Pool area needs renovation. Attitude of reception staff poor."
16.10.2014,5,A great experience. Hygiene great. Staff friendly and always at your service. Great choice of delicious food. Objection would be ill-equipped fitness room with old machines.Rooms spacious and very comfortable.
3.10.2014,4,"Attended a two day conference held at this hotel. Very pleasantly surprised to find the hotel was brimming with high quality pool and spa and very friendly and helpful staff. Although not everyone had perfect english, but enough did!Rooms were spacious and very clean with a spacious balcony.If I were to visit Slovenia again - be happy to stay"

Although it was fun for as too. there are some slides and pools for adults. only the night life is poor. food is more than great. near the hotel is few little charming towns where were some nice restaurants."
16.01.2015,5,"If you want to spend a few days feeling like you've steped into paradise, than you must visit small town Catez ob Savi in Slovenia, It is situaded on termal waters, so that in fantastic hotels there is over 30 swim pools with many welllnes and spa centers. There is a great number of places for children to play, so you may call it A family paradise. Ljubljana and Zagreb are within 50 miles, so you may organize a visit to this lovely cities. All in all, a must for all!."
12.09.2014,4,"It was not our first visit of this hotel, so we knew where are we going. We stayed at the main building, not the smaller wooden one. Hotel Toplice is located right in the main thermal riviera of Èatež ob Savi. It the price of there is a half-broad and an entrance to a indoor and outdoor aqua park. But otherwise, this hotel is too expensive.The rooms are really old, like the rest of the hotel. The carpets are faded, the TV is at least 15 years old and the bath leaks. Otherwise, when it was new it was a beautiful hotel room. The staff at the reception desk was a little witted, but the waiters and waitress in the restaurant were professional.The main reason why we went here is the outdoor aqua park. We wanted to visit it, but it was closed because of the bad weather. So we could just visit the smaller inside aqua park, which was not as good as the huge outdoor one.Breakfasts were really tasty, but there was not much food there. But the dinners were delicious, but the selection of food was smaller since our last visit 2 years ago. Overall, this place could be a real paradise, but the hotel is old and the staff is unprofessional. Also before arrival you should check the weather forecast!"
30.08.2014,5,"My daughter learned to swim here! All of us really loved the pool area, it is very warm and clean. Our suite was big and beds were good so we could rest after all day at pools. Restaurant was a bit crowded but staff workig there were so great and always ready to help find the table and prepare bay food. Big thanks to them. Food at tne restaurant was very tasty and they even have lunch buffet which costed 10€ per person and you could eat as much as you wanted. There are a few spots to visit around hotel and the nature is fantastic. We all loved it!"
27.08.2014,4,"Nice hotel, good room, clean and very nice people on reception. Activities in and around hotel is the best part of all. Aqua park, termal riviera, couple of bars and cafes, casino, kids club and animation. Everything is good organized. Breakfast and dinner are very good with big choice of food. This is a place for family."
18.08.2014,4,"Pro:1. Hotel is pretty descent.2. Apartment room has 2 WC's and it is kept very clean (thanks Nada)3. Used HB arrangement for the family, and it is quite enough.4. Food is good and plenty5. Pools are outside and inside. In both of the pools, water is visually clean and constantly checked by the personnel ( I actually saw personnel who was checking the water with proper equipment)6. Every night except monday there is some sort of entertainment done by the staff from the hotel. Especially my kids loved the ""kids disco"".7. Near the hotel is located small amusement park. It is not much to expect, but all of those blinking lights makes children to be there.8. Inside resort are also Indian village with vinghnam tents (yes people are actually staying inside), horse-wagon style room, than ordinary camping area and so on and so on.9. Nice personnel Con:1. Too much people on pool toboggans2. Absolutely the most sh...est internet. At least when you offer it as package - do provide it. Otherwise sell it. Don't frustrate your guests."
18.02.2014,3,"Hotel's rating maybe was suitable when it was built and all new, now the renovation of rooms and especially restaurant is much needed for a hotel to be worth four stars. Food isn't bad, but not very good either. We weren't even thrilled with pools, but we're really not keen of pools anyway. The main reason of our visit were Wellness services, and we were all pleased with that, but it just wasn't enough for us to be willing to return, especially with their high prices. I believe there are many other Wellness/Spa hotels in Slovenia which are much more worth their price and suitable for couple's weekend vacation."
13.02.2014,4,This hotel is just great for kids. What I liked the most is that the pools and the rooms are under the same roof which is really important if you are there during winter months and with children. Breakfast was ok. We were there for 5 days and it was a bit too much even for kids. I think 3 days is great. Be aware tgat during weekends and holidays this place is crowded and the pools are not very clean...
12.02.2014,4,"We arrived after 5 hours drive and waited for an hour and a half to check in. Total disorganization at the reception. The rooms are great, really modern, spacious, but the shower cabin is too small. The hotel pool is ok but the jakuzzi is horrible, you can see rust in it. Food is of average quality. All in all rooms are a 4 star everything else 3 star hotel."
5.02.2014,3,"We stayed in hotel Toplice for three days in the January 2014 as family with 6-year old boy. This was our second visit and our impressions are different than 4 years ago, but not in a better way. Hotel definitely does not deserve 4*. Rooms are clean, but old fashion, with worn furniture and carpets and old fashion TV with broken control remoter. Internet connection and mobile signal are poor. We took HB. Breakfast was relatively OK, but really poor choice of meals for dinner considering 4*. Also, hygiene in restaurant could be better as well as courtesy of personnel. Prices in restaurant and in general are too high. The offer in hotel Toplice is definitely not good value for money.Thermal Riviera is fantastic – guarantee a lot of fun and pleasure for kids and adults, so you forget all negative things about hotel."
17.09.2013,4,"We stayed in this hotel several times during 2011 and 2012 and each time we had a great fun.The rooms are spacious and clean. TV programme is poor (some 8 channels) altough you don't need it, since you are occupied during the day and quite sleepy in the evening.The food is good but not various, you will find the same offer of meals every day.The hotel complex is surrounded with nice green area, with lot's of flowers, trees , benches for rest and small alleys to walk.Within complex you have a grocery store, few cafes , few restorants where you can eat but you will be unpleasantly suprised with the prices .But when you enter to the area of pools within winter and summer riviera, you will forget all the weaknesses, mentioned above , and you will have THE HOLIDAY.Our 5 year old son loved it, and i have to be honest, once we tried some water slides ,we became the children again. The fun is garantied. The water is warm (about 33 degrees).The pools are clean. Children adore pirate ship within winter riviera and you can let them play in it for hours.The summer riviera is better equipped , with more pools, better water slides.But definitely you will not make mistake if you choose this destination for your vacation."
19.08.2013,4,I have visited this Hotel with my family in the beginning of August 2013 and have stayed for 3 days. Our 2 year son really enjoyed indoor/outdoor swimming pools as well as me any my husband. The complex is really good for the families with children (either small or toddlers) and have solid food offer with various meals. WiFi connection is very poor - on the balcony there is no connection at all and in the periods when most of the guests are in their rooms it is almost impossible to connect on the Internet. The hotel has solid rooms (not exactly 4 stars) but it is more than sufficient for the time you spend in the room. All in all we had great time and a lot of fun!
16.08.2013,3,"After spending a week at Hotel Toplice, i can tell its a gd place for family holidays with a lot of swimming pools, gd spa and lot of entertainment for kids, however Internet connection its just BAD, to be able to have internet in my room, i had to go in the toilet that was the only place within my room to have internet otherwise you need to be in the reception area where you get up to 1Mb download, pretty low for a 4 star hotel."
20.05.2013,3,"After visiting Hotel Toplice I can say that it doesn't leave any special notice. Most of the services are pretty much average, prices on things in general (rooms, services) are a bit too high for this part of Slovenia. Unless if you aren't really big fan of spas, wellness centres, swimming pools, sport activities (as bowling, tennis, fitness...) and massages, you probably won't find anything interesting if you'll focus on staying only in Hotel Toplice.As it goes for place itself: it is really friendly for young familys with children. Restaurant has special place where children can play a bit and have fun with other children so parents can take a bit of a rest during and after lunch or dinning.Staff in Hotel Toplice is very friendly, helpfull and generally very good with communicating with customers in other languages.As I have mentioned already, Hotel Toplice is pretty average otherwise but some people are sometimes looking specially for that. But those who love that place are keep on returning every year."
4.05.2013,4,"I saw a hotel just from outside and not the rooms. I have also seen all the services, dinig room, fitness center and sport center. The staff is very fiendly, smiling and ready to help. Surroundig is very friendly, it´s also children playground, touristic information center, pastry shop and a lot of touristic little shops. It`s also very clean everywhere, so I would recommend this hotel to familly who has little children."

16.04.2013,4,"This is a great place for a short vacation with the kids. When you're afraid that the weather won't allow you pleasant trips to the countryside, you can be sure that the ""winter spa"" will entertain the family all day long. It is actually more of an indoor water park than a spa, with five slides ranging from the most tame suitable for toddlers to the nearly vertical, and even one that starts inside and drops you under the sky (and whatever falls from it) but into warm water.Coming to this specific hotel, we chose the Toplice because it's the nearest one to the spa: many guests (including us) went between their room and the spa dressed only with a bathrobe. We booked a suite for our family of four. The accommodation is quite basic, the suite is actually a large room with a corner furnished as living area, where the sofa-bed was opened to sleep two. The bathrobes and towels were few and somewhat worn. These however are all the negative details we noticed: besides, the room was spotless clean, it had a nice balcony (which we could only look at, since it kept raining for our whole stay), and a spacious bathroom.The buffet restaurant was quite good, there was always enough variety for us and the kids, and the average quality of the food was rather high, especially that of the meat dishes.The website offered a choice of discount packages, but not finding one that exactly suited our needs we made an inquiry through the contact form, and received an answer the following morning for a tailored package, with a significant discount on the base rate. The good service continued throughout our stay.We'll visit this place again."
7.11.2012,4,"I stayed in this hotel for over than two weeks. Rooms are spacious and have nice balcony. They are cleaned and the walls were freshly painted but some of the furniture is already worn out and should be replaced. The food is various and very good. Breakfast was my favorite part with the selection of pastry, fresh fruits, salami, cheese, bacon, eggs and even Eco corner. In two weeks I just managed to try everything out. Lunch and dinner also do not disappoint. All three meals are self service all you can eat restaurants. The hotel is attached to the indoor thermal riviera. It is especially a place to bring children but there is also big swimming pool without slides. The hotel is also connected to the spa center and is steps away from outside swimming pool area. The staff is helpful and nice."
1.10.2012,4,"We booked a few days in Slovenia and got a recommendation for the therms when we joined the Hotel Toplice. The service is solid, the staff is obliging, the food was OK, fresh from a buffet with self service. It's a good family hotel, the room was in good condition. Some features like the TV was not the newest, but air condition, cleanliness was fine and I could recommend this hotel once being at the terms. There are indeed some better 4 star hotels but it's no way less than 4 stars."
10.07.2012,4,"Great family vacation, and a good value for your money. The food was excellent. A lot of various activities for the kids."
20.05.2012,4,"This was the perfect family holiday in a hotel that has a central position and is connected by underground tunnel to the hotel Èatež and Wellness Center and Spa. Hotel Toplice is also directly connected with the Winter Thermal Riviera, which is a real treasure for relaxation and enjoyment. Restaurant is good, it has a fantastic buffet, the food is tailored for diabetics. Evening was organized at the Mini Club for kids with animators who speak several languages??. I recommend this hotel for those who want to relax with their family."
16.01.2015,5,"If you want to spend a few days feeling like you've steped into paradise, than you must visit small town Catez ob Savi in Slovenia, It is situaded on termal waters, so that in fantastic hotels there is over 30 swim pools with many welllnes and spa centers. There is a great number of places for children to play, so you may call it A family paradise. Ljubljana and Zagreb are within 50 miles, so you may organize a visit to this lovely cities. All in all, a must for all!."
12.09.2014,4,"It was not our first visit of this hotel, so we knew where are we going. We stayed at the main building, not the smaller wooden one. Hotel Toplice is located right in the main thermal riviera of Èatež ob Savi. It the price of there is a half-broad and an entrance to a indoor and outdoor aqua park. But otherwise, this hotel is too expensive.The rooms are really old, like the rest of the hotel. The carpets are faded, the TV is at least 15 years old and the bath leaks. Otherwise, when it was new it was a beautiful hotel room. The staff at the reception desk was a little witted, but the waiters and waitress in the restaurant were professional.The main reason why we went here is the outdoor aqua park. We wanted to visit it, but it was closed because of the bad weather. So we could just visit the smaller inside aqua park, which was not as good as the huge outdoor one.Breakfasts were really tasty, but there was not much food there. But the dinners were delicious, but the selection of food was smaller since our last visit 2 years ago. Overall, this place could be a real paradise, but the hotel is old and the staff is unprofessional. Also before arrival you should check the weather forecast!"
30.08.2014,5,"My daughter learned to swim here! All of us really loved the pool area, it is very warm and clean. Our suite was big and beds were good so we could rest after all day at pools. Restaurant was a bit crowded but staff workig there were so great and always ready to help find the table and prepare bay food. Big thanks to them. Food at tne restaurant was very tasty and they even have lunch buffet which costed 10€ per person and you could eat as much as you wanted. There are a few spots to visit around hotel and the nature is fantastic. We all loved it!"
27.08.2014,4,"Nice hotel, good room, clean and very nice people on reception. Activities in and around hotel is the best part of all. Aqua park, termal riviera, couple of bars and cafes, casino, kids club and animation. Everything is good organized. Breakfast and dinner are very good with big choice of food. This is a place for family."

3.04.2015,4,Came here with teenagers and small children and lots of fun was had by all. As it was still cold the outside area was closed but we had plenty to do inside with all the various water slides and jacuzzi's. We didn't eat there but the self service restaurant had a good selection of food. Plenty of lockers and rooms.
24.03.2015,3,"Ok. My review is maybe rough because Catez is one of the best in aria. But that doesn't approve their low level. In the winter time work only inside park pools which is normal,but..boring. It's nice view inside.. but.. And 16eur for ticket is to expensive only for pool. It's good for kids, and that's it. Old cabin,old showers,no extra hot water,bad jacuzzi,nothing change long time ago. In the summer time is better and pick that dates. Hotels so-so,food correct.  Probably I will give them last chance in summer...For my opinion..better go to Olimia and pay more but all is include and all is new.."
15.03.2015,5,"Since I visited many European spas, I can definitely say that this is one of the best. Beautiful pools, beautiful environment, rich selection of food and beverages. Service is at the highest level and to anyone who has the opportunity I recommend to visit Terme Catez."
9.03.2015,5,That idea is really cool and enjoy full for everyone.. Also RELAX all the time.. The personal is young and friendly.. English is enough for a basic comunication.. I definitely advice to You.. ;)
16.02.2015,3,"Went to hotel Terme at Catez for a relaxing weekend. For a four star wellness hotel it is really not a high standard one would expect. Maybe better suited for families with children. Spa zone rather small, too crowded, buffet breakfast and dinner unimaginative, dishes served not very attractive, slow service... The rooms are renovated few years ago which is visible, lobby area clean, restaurant as well but all in all not very good value for money."
14.02.2015,5,"Gorgeous spa located in a quite area.I have eben in The day, living near and i went with my son : he enjoyed IT so much that he did not want more to go on.The price of The ticket is 16 euro for The all day : there are changing rooms, showers, and everything you need.I would go back in The summer when there are open all The outdoor area."
2.02.2015,5,"We were fascinated by the great variety of pools: amazonian forest, pirate bay, wave surfing, great speed tobogan... The pool restaurant wasn't so good and expensive."
1.01.2015,1,"It can be a really nice place. But, there are too many people, tickets are too expencive for that what you get. Deck chairs are very dangerous!!! Everything seems very old and need refreshing. Food and drinks are also too expencive for quality that you got, so take them with yourself. Also, detail cleaning is a must asap."
28.12.2014,1,"We went to Catez by coincidence (no other spa had room since we started looking at the last minute). I'll start from the beginning. We booked a 4 star hotel, our expectations not so high. We arrived and after carrying our own luggage to the rooms by ourselves, we entered the bedrooms- furniture from the 70's, white walls with NO pictures or anything, curtains that haven't been washed in ages, stained couch and thin blankets on the bed. I repeat, a 4 STAR hotel. The blankness of the room made me queasy. No towels and you have to pay for the robes (other spa resorts hand them out in the room) but they didn't even had any left- what kind of spa resort doesn't have any robes available??The pool was awful. Everything old, the vents haven't been cleaned in 5 years at least, walls cracked, the gym has a few working machines and they are lacking in staff.The food was awful. As basic as it gets- breakfast table didn't even have a toaster or fresh juice, also coffee is more water then coffee. And you're lucky to even get a table for dinner, that has a terrible menu- fried food and sausages, with the exception of grilled fish now and then.The sauna zone is overpriced and unorganized.There isn't one thing I would highlight as good. We were forced to fully pay in advance, so once we came we couldn't leave (what we would probably do).Overall, I really do not understand how that place could ever get 4 stars. It hasn't been renovated in 30 years, organization awful, everything severely overpriced and bad quality, to the point that the 'hard boiled' eggs on the breakfast tray were fully liquid.This hotel has no soul, terrible and uncomfortable. I will NEVER EVER comeback."
24.11.2014,1,"Probably the loudest indoor swimming pool in this planet!If they only would stop playing the radio stations.Because the music can't be heard at all (difficult to even figure out which song plays), in fact it just adds to the horrible noise. Have a look at attached noise diagram and compare against info http://www.cochlea.org/en/noise (measured with iphone app, so probably not 100% accurate, but it gives the idea ..)Bring some ear plugs or bose headphones if your plan is to relax in this place!On top of bad noise, the food in pool restaurant is total junk. Sorry, I do not have a better expression.My bowl of ""goulas"" arrived with 9 small pieces of meat, 5 of them full of grass of ugly taste, and the sauce was some kind of brown colour floured mess...Kids got ""wiener"" steaks, literally soaked in oil - and the oil smelled like 10x over-burnt ...Never again!"
22.10.2014,3,"I spent a weekend with my family in terme catez, hotel terme. The romms are really good, the lobby and reception area very bad and and old needs to be redone asap, tje food in restaurant was ok, nothing special but the thing i didn't understand at all are the too high prices for anything you buy inside the complex."
11.10.2014,4,Like everything except one major thing.there were no roaps to rent and the tovels we rent were very poor.
18.09.2014,4,"Very large site, thermal pools were amazing. So many of them and all at 34 degrees. Food and drink was passable and not expensive by Uk standards.Loads of mobile homes, hotels, tents, motorhomes and villages - but nothing to do after 9pm!Kids loves it for the pools, but could do with an entertainment programme.One other point - It is starting to look a little dated , very eastern block."
7.09.2014,3,"Prices inside the area are too expensive. The workers also not always have a nice attitude. Wifi in mobile homes doesnt work - just occasionally. Food in inner restaurants is awfull. But the kids like it and there are nice restaurants, pubs etc in nearby surroundings. Some outer pools should also be renewed."
23.08.2014,3,"After 10 years I visited them again with my family, now a bit bigger kids (5-9-13). Although the kids enjoyed the attractions, for me it was disappointing, as barely nothing changed. The prices are very high, so no real value for money is offered. Big plus for the children is the warm water, as it's a thermal site, so they can spend the whole day in the water."
21.08.2014,3,"We stayed for 5 days in a mobile home on campsite. Campsite is ok, but in the evenings there's not a lot going around. Waterpark is nice, with lots of attractions and the temperature is ok, but may be too warm when it's really hot outside. However it needs renovation, many parts look dirty and the whole site looks outdated. This also applies fot the inside swimming pool complex. Stupid rule is that you are only allowed to one pool on a day. So you have to decide to go inside or outside, you can not switch unless you pay extra. This is very strange and ridicilous. Overall nice for a few days, when the weather is ok."
9.08.2014,1,"Dirty, old needs renovation, crowded and totaly overpriced and disgussting.Nothing more to say about this place and i am not starting to write about the hotel rooms."
15.07.2014,1,"One of the most terrible spots you can choose for vacation. Try to avoid the inside pool which needs a lot of cleaning and of course a major renovation. The restaurants are horrible and the food a complete junk. The camping reminds of favela, whit a part more like a gipsy village than the indian they promote. The stuff is unkind and the camping supermarket an unplesant surprise. The whole experiance is like a trip in the past. Horrible!"
16.05.2014,4,"First of all I must agree with other reviewers that the place is in need of a renovation,but on the other hand it is a paradise for kids of all ages so if you overlook the run down reception and outdated tiles you can actually have fun! The pirate ship play-pool was a blast for our 2 year old.We were staying in Catez hotel and were connected to the Riviera by a underground tunnel which turned out to be a great thing because the weather was terrible. The only ""glitch"" was the enormous crowd!!! It was the May 1st holiday and people where literally like sardines in the pools, you could not find a free lounger or chair to put down your towel.Another thing I would like to warn possible-future visitors is the restaurant, it sells inedible overpriced junk food. Do avoid!"
24.03.2014,2,"We visited Winter Thermal Riviera on a spring rainy day. After parking our car (there is plenty of parking space), the first thing that we saw was a complex of shabby looking ""huts"" selling all sorts of Made in China stuff. Things did not improve as we entered the Riviera. The reception area is run-down, the lockers old and kind of smelly. The showers & toilets are really old (I remember going to Terme Catez as a kid and I think the tiles have not been update since my childhood). When we entered the pool area, it was really hard to find loungers, as the pools were overcrowded. We were lucky that some people were leaving and after seeing us looking around told us that we could use theirs. The pools are quite OK, there are several slides (mostly for smaller kids), several baby pools and a pool with pirate ship - paradise for small kids. There are also some jacuzzi-es, and swimmable pools (if they are not overcrowded). Our kids had a blast on the slides, they are gentle enough that kids can ride on their own.There is a self-service restaurant in the pool area serving typical junk food: french fries, wiener-schnittzel, fried cheese. One can only wish for some healthier choices. Prices: 45€ for 2 adult and 1 child tickets (kids under 4 are free of charge), we paid 33€ for lunch (which was not tasty at all).Overall verdict: kids will most likely enjoy the visit, but the place really need some renovations. There are much nicer thermal spas in Slovenia, so I would not recommend this one at all."
1.02.2014,4,We have been going to Catez every year since my son was three. It's a great place in the winter just before the Christmas holidays because there are several indoor pools. The half board is also good with a good variety of food at night and there are animators for the kids after dinner. Our kids love Catez.
24.12.2013,4,My family had a great time here. We stayed in the apartments and found it to be reasonably priced. Both my wife and I had a massage that was good. If you go during the off season it is not crowded and the prices for accomodations are less. We went in late October in the middle of the week and had the place to ourselves. I don't think we would have had as much fun if we would have been there in the summer with all the crowds. We traveled with another family and all the kids had a blast. Older teens may get board after a few hours but those 4-12 that are good swmimmers will be able to go forever.
18.09.2013,3,"I would give it 2 stars but thanks for the good service and the fact that it was almost empty - I gave it 3 stars. It is expensive - if you want to go to the winter and the summer parts, family of 4 will pay 70 euro (20 euro deposit for the hand bracelet). It was quiet chilly when we got there so we decided to go only to the winter part (47 euro). The main pool was out of order, something that they should have say to us and should charge less money. After a while the sun came out and we realized that we are mainly outside with one (!) slide that our children could use. We got back to the cashier and asked to pay for the entrance to the summer part. We were ready to pay for it but the manager (or the boss of the place) was there and he kindly suggested that we move to the summer part, free of charge. The summer part is much more fun - don't miss that. The water are warm so even it was 18-20 degrees, inside the water it was OK. Facilities at the summer part are not provided (no lockers, you will have to pay for chairs and umbrellas). If you need to choose - go to the summer part only. And if it is rainy day - ask if everything is working inside."
26.08.2013,1,"Rainy weather drove us to seek refuge in the Terme Catez. Our five year old loved the place bit it was my idea of hell.. Everything she wanted water, slides and lots of other children. My mum had a full body massage which she was was very nice but even in the room she could hear the loud music that is played throughout the place. Not the most relaxing environment. Every bed has a towel on it so finding somewhere to leave belonging never mind sit was impossible. We made the mistake of not taking footwear to walk about in and the wet floors are lethal. It reminded me of the worst aspects of local authority swimming pools especially the changing area. Never again!"
13.08.2013,4,"This spa offers good accomodation, various spa treatments and great riviera which is a complex of indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Hotel Catez *** has nice buffet and the rooms are clean."
6.08.2013,3,Like camping on a charmless industrial park. No shade and no real character. Redeemed in part however by very good attached water park.
2.07.2013,5,"food is great, pools and slides are just awesome to kids from 8 to like forever, restaurant is great, the whole atmosphere is just amazing, staff is friendly, most of them speak English which I find very important and there's a life guardian and special surfing place for the middle class who can't afford Portugal to go to surf :)regards"
27.06.2013,3,"We stayed there one night. There are nice attractions for the kids and big swimming pools. But the service is not very good. First we waited very long at the reception. Afterwards they said the room we reserved is not available but they will give us a better one for no extra cost. So far so good. On the next day when checking out we again waited a long queue and there was another guy at the reception who charged us extra money for the room. So be prepared for little ""cheatings"" and ""surprises""."
4.05.2013,3,"Nice outside pools, lots of stuff for the children, clean dressing rooms... Staff could be more polite and the food is far form good..."
8.04.2013,5,"We have visited Èatež 4 times so far. My children absolutely love this water park! We went to another spa one year and the children were very disappointed, so we keep coming back to Èatež.The Winter riviera can get pretty crowded, especially during the main holidays. If you would like to relax in a quiet place, then you'd better stay around the hotel pools. This is a children's paradise, with many pools, slides, a pirate ship...They never get tired. The restaurant in the Winter riviera could be better.The Summer riviera is even bigger and better. The slides are bigger and there are more attractions and restaurants. As it is bigger it's not so crowded."
17.02.2013,4,"There are plenty of water slides to chose from. During summer they can get quite crowded, especially in the outdoor pools. The most fun happens outside. Hotels and food in them is quite good too. The indoor pools, which are open all year, are great too, however they have much less water slides in them.There are also other activities which you can do, such as bowling, gambling etc."
6.12.2012,4,I was there last summer with family in Hotel Terme. Rooms are average or below that. Breakfast or dinner was great with planty of choice. Attraction are great but it too crowd and too much people in pools.
23.10.2012,5,"Not right location. Right location is Catez ob Savi, Topliska ulica 50, Slovenia:)So please fix that :) now its about 30km difference :)"
4.10.2012,1,The therme looks nice and on the way to the south we decided to stay there for 2 days. Even it was not a week-end it was very crowded. There are some attractions for the kids and you cannot say they have not taken care to have a good offer. However the pool made all of us sick. We got deseases in the genital area for the first time in our lives and my son got inflammation of ears. It was definately because of the pool as the doctors said and obviously due to not enough chlorinated water. This was summer 2011.
21.08.2012,2,Service poor. The reception always crowded as not enough staff. They did not bother to show us the apartments and area so had to find own way. The apartments tired and dirty with half stuff missing. Main slides crowded and dirty. Also had to hire sun loungers. If you loose the card then they try to charge you an extra 5€ daily. There are very few other English families.The winter side of the complex much better with a surf machine.
18.08.2012,4,"This complex of pools consists of outside and inside part. Outside part is much larger, and much busier than the inside part. We stayed mostly in the later, and kids enjoyed it so much. Pools appeared to be well maintained (apart from 2-3 spots where underwater lights were broken and cable was floating loosely, causing suspicion with some swimmers). Tiny restaurant within inner complex offers basic menu, but tasty and with generous portion sizes. Staff there is kind and professional.Only remarks apply to non-efficient system of entering the complex (using smartcards) - it is slow and people queue up sometimes, even with the attendant present on the spot; also, changing rooms/cabins look like they are leftovers from socialism times - they better replace them soon, so they fit the rest of the otherwise modern complex of pools."
24.05.2012,4,"We visited Terme Catez winter riviera for the second time, and we enjoyed very much! Our 3-year old son was trilled with pools and slides. We choose Catez Apartments for our stay. Lux apartment is a small house with spacious dinning room, bathroom and nice terrace on the ground. Master bedroom and children's bedroom are upstairs. It has everything you need for cooking and preparing the meals. there is barbecue in the garden terrace. It's perfect place for families with young children, there are plenty things to do, especially for the young ones. Playgrounds on open and indoor as well, biking, swimming, walking... It is quiet and nice place."
25.03.2012,4,I were in terme catez in winter so the outdoor pools and rides were closed but there is a slide where yo can get out and be in a pool surrounded with snow i really liked jumping in the snow and then back in the hot water :)
23.02.2012,5,"Pleasant neighborhood people and the staff very friendly, everyone is always at your service, wonderful for families. A lot of facilities for recreation, excellent spa center. Beautiful scenery for walks and excursions to nearby places. The food excellent."
7.02.2012,4,"Nice place to recharge batteries. We usualy stop there on our way to winter holiday. The good thing about this place is that they take care and the system recognises you :-) as someone who is ""coming back"". On our last visit we get express confirmation, did not pay any deposit and got upgrade without even asking for :-). we are family with two children and usualy take appartment - it is very convinient and spacious for family."
3.04.2015,4,Came here with teenagers and small children and lots of fun was had by all. As it was still cold the outside area was closed but we had plenty to do inside with all the various water slides and jacuzzi's. We didn't eat there but the self service restaurant had a good selection of food. Plenty of lockers and rooms.
24.03.2015,3,"Ok. My review is maybe rough because Catez is one of the best in aria. But that doesn't approve their low level. In the winter time work only inside park pools which is normal,but..boring. It's nice view inside.. but.. And 16eur for ticket is to expensive only for pool. It's good for kids, and that's it. Old cabin,old showers,no extra hot water,bad jacuzzi,nothing change long time ago. In the summer time is better and pick that dates. Hotels so-so,food correct.  Probably I will give them last chance in summer...For my opinion..better go to Olimia and pay more but all is include and all is new.."
15.03.2015,5,"Since I visited many European spas, I can definitely say that this is one of the best. Beautiful pools, beautiful environment, rich selection of food and beverages. Service is at the highest level and to anyone who has the opportunity I recommend to visit Terme Catez."
9.03.2015,5,That idea is really cool and enjoy full for everyone.. Also RELAX all the time.. The personal is young and friendly.. English is enough for a basic comunication.. I definitely advice to You.. ;)
16.02.2015,3,"Went to hotel Terme at Catez for a relaxing weekend. For a four star wellness hotel it is really not a high standard one would expect. Maybe better suited for families with children. Spa zone rather small, too crowded, buffet breakfast and dinner unimaginative, dishes served not very attractive, slow service... The rooms are renovated few years ago which is visible, lobby area clean, restaurant as well but all in all not very good value for money."
14.02.2015,5,"Gorgeous spa located in a quite area.I have eben in The day, living near and i went with my son : he enjoyed IT so much that he did not want more to go on.The price of The ticket is 16 euro for The all day : there are changing rooms, showers, and everything you need.I would go back in The summer when there are open all The outdoor area."
2.02.2015,5,"We were fascinated by the great variety of pools: amazonian forest, pirate bay, wave surfing, great speed tobogan... The pool restaurant wasn't so good and expensive."
1.01.2015,1,"It can be a really nice place. But, there are too many people, tickets are too expencive for that what you get. Deck chairs are very dangerous!!! Everything seems very old and need refreshing. Food and drinks are also too expencive for quality that you got, so take them with yourself. Also, detail cleaning is a must asap."
28.12.2014,1,"We went to Catez by coincidence (no other spa had room since we started looking at the last minute). I'll start from the beginning. We booked a 4 star hotel, our expectations not so high. We arrived and after carrying our own luggage to the rooms by ourselves, we entered the bedrooms- furniture from the 70's, white walls with NO pictures or anything, curtains that haven't been washed in ages, stained couch and thin blankets on the bed. I repeat, a 4 STAR hotel. The blankness of the room made me queasy. No towels and you have to pay for the robes (other spa resorts hand them out in the room) but they didn't even had any left- what kind of spa resort doesn't have any robes available??The pool was awful. Everything old, the vents haven't been cleaned in 5 years at least, walls cracked, the gym has a few working machines and they are lacking in staff.The food was awful. As basic as it gets- breakfast table didn't even have a toaster or fresh juice, also coffee is more water then coffee. And you're lucky to even get a table for dinner, that has a terrible menu- fried food and sausages, with the exception of grilled fish now and then.The sauna zone is overpriced and unorganized.There isn't one thing I would highlight as good. We were forced to fully pay in advance, so once we came we couldn't leave (what we would probably do).Overall, I really do not understand how that place could ever get 4 stars. It hasn't been renovated in 30 years, organization awful, everything severely overpriced and bad quality, to the point that the 'hard boiled' eggs on the breakfast tray were fully liquid.This hotel has no soul, terrible and uncomfortable. I will NEVER EVER comeback."
24.11.2014,1,"Probably the loudest indoor swimming pool in this planet!If they only would stop playing the radio stations.Because the music can't be heard at all (difficult to even figure out which song plays), in fact it just adds to the horrible noise. Have a look at attached noise diagram and compare against info http://www.cochlea.org/en/noise (measured with iphone app, so probably not 100% accurate, but it gives the idea ..)Bring some ear plugs or bose headphones if your plan is to relax in this place!On top of bad noise, the food in pool restaurant is total junk. Sorry, I do not have a better expression.My bowl of ""goulas"" arrived with 9 small pieces of meat, 5 of them full of grass of ugly taste, and the sauce was some kind of brown colour floured mess...Kids got ""wiener"" steaks, literally soaked in oil - and the oil smelled like 10x over-burnt ...Never again!"
25.03.2015,5,"So this is a review about Wellness Orhidelia, part of Terme Olimia. It's the newer part of the complex and a really fancy one.Big pools with underwater music (yes, you read that right), there are 5 or 6 saunas, IR, finnish, turkish...They have a lot of quiet resting places, with big beds for 2 people, there is also a room with water beds.Everything is really modern, ""fancy"" if you would like to call it like that.It's not on the cheap end, but definitly worth the visit if you are nearby.Would give it 10 stars if that was possible :D"
22.03.2015,5,"We've been in the new part of this spa, named Orhidelia, about ten times and the only problem is that when you visit this place once you don't want to go anywhere else! So we did! Relaxation for body and soul in the beautiful and modern designed interior with friendly staff. It's hard to talk about experience in this place with words. You must feel it by visiting this place!"
5.03.2015,5,"We stayed at the Sotelia hotel for a weekend, enjoying their spa center, saunas, whirlpools and good food. The rooms are very nice, clean, enjoyable. Lots of choices from dinner menu. The price is very fair for the offered. Look for actions/specials on their website."
16.02.2015,5,"This spa is the best place for winter relaxation. All pools are warm, water clean, beds comfortable. The staff is kind and welcoming. The spa is big so you can do different things each day - swim, go to sauna, get massage, sleep etc. I like the lavender color which is the main color of all the facilities, so soothing...There's an entrance fee, you're given a chip bracelet so you can move freely and forget about carrying the wallet. If you're a guest of one of the nearby hotels, your fee is a bit lower.Also there are many walking paths around the complex you can use and see the castle, the Podcetrtek town or some other landmarks. If the weather is nice, got to one of cafes in Podcetrtek and enjoy the sunshine!"
10.02.2015,5,"I am regular guest of Terme Olimia because the staff is very friendly, it is very clean and well organized (no cash required within complex). Wellcard lotalty programm is excellent for regular guests.Tipically I visit Termalia and Sauna World a few times a month for pleasant relaxation. I try not miss any sauna programmes which are held by Slovenia's best sauna professionals. Termalia offers indoor and outdoor pools with water attractions and self service restaurant. You and your children will have full day of water fun at affordable price.When I want luxury and space - I strech my wallet a bit for Orchidelia. It is a mix of indoor and outdoor pools, spas and saunas, very good on-pool restaurant, large lockers and private shower rooms. Entry fee includes bathrobe and towel. Key word is space, a lot of space and self-pampering. Try not to miss free of charge sauna programs. No textile friday evenings (FKK) and late night working hours on fridays and saturdays (open till midnight).Massages in Termalia and Orchidelia are really excellent. Try house specials - especially Amala and Vitae.TIP: On the bottom of any receipt will find Wi-Fi code for ine hour of Internet. Acommodation offer is also rich here. Hotels Sotelia and Breza offer variety of standards and designs. If you like apartments, I can also recommend staying in Olimia.Surroundings offer interesting sites for walking and hiking, chocolate factory and other gastronomic delights. I haven't visited summer complex Aqualuna. It is on my to-do. :)"
7.02.2015,5,Orhidelia spa is for sure the perfect jem if you need a relaxing day for the soul and body. They have for the best saunas in Slovenia. The arhitecture inside the saunas is amazing and the teraphies they offer are the best i ever tried. I recomend this place a lot!
7.01.2015,4,"We stayed in Therme Olimia (Sotelia) for three nights. I enjoyed it. It was a lovely combination of walks, breathing and relaxing in pools and saunas. Our room was spacious and cozy, with everything needed - slippers, gowns, nice cosmetics, convenient shower. I did not like the pillows though, they were flat and a bit untidy, it felt like many people have used them before..And pieces of soap provided were really tiny, ridiculosely small! The breakfast is really rich and various! It included interesting local dishes, like cottage cheese with truffle oil, etc. I was surprised, that there was a queue to get coffee (by the way, coffee was not tasty).Dinner buffet is delicious as well, I can recommend it.In the evening there was nice live music in Barago bar.The pool territory in Termalia is huge! We especially enjoyed swimming outside - unbelievably relaxing and real fun! The water is warm enough not to feel uncomfortably cold.The sauna world impressed me - I have rather big experience in SPA resorts, but have never seen so many types of saunas!! Maybe even too much - it takes special time to remember everything and realize, where to go, and try most of them.I was delighted with the bracelet system - if you forget the number of your box, it reminds. Complete relax!We were not ready to see so many naked men in saunas. There was a contrast: families with kids in pools, and mostly men without underwear in saunas. Feels like you came here by mistake. Confusing.The hotel is good, but there is not much to see and do near it. For three-five days - perfect, but not more. "
5.12.2014,4,"The best Hotel-Sotelia. The best SPA Orhidelia.The worst possible restaurant - Restavracija Lipa. Beef carpacio with no taste, beef stake that should be medium rare totally overcooked, after the dinner we smelt like eating in the wordt olace possible.."
22.11.2014,5,"We're regularly going and enjoying the spa, wellness and pools facilities in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Slovenia, but have never been in anything similar to Orhidelia section of Terme Omelia. I don't know for the rest of the complex, but the Orhidelia spa is the one of its kind and the place I will visit on regular basis (4.5 hours of regular drive from Belgrade) with my girlfriend whenever I have the opportunity for it.My only recomendation is that - although there is a more general area on the ground floor for the whole families - this place, especially on the first floor, is just for the couples only who would like to relax from the everyday life and to enjoy in the fabolous ambient, unique architecture and the beautiful and spacious spa contents. And, first of all, in his/her loving one."
6.10.2014,5,"This is the best spa I have ever seen. Purple shades in the pool area, oval and separated pools with warm thermal water give you the impresion of isolation and your own private time. Here you could chose between two wellness and spa area - one more luxury, peaceful and intimate, and the other one dedicated to the family full with water atractions."
25.09.2014,5,it is very nice place hot water you can visit summer or winter not far from lublijana you can stay in hotel or you can rent self catering apartments
11.09.2014,4,"We spent 3 days in terme olimia (hotel breza). Wellness orhidelia is very nice and modern with beautiful swimming pools,saunas and other atractions. Massages at spa amala were excellent as well. On the other side, wellness termalia is outdated and lacks activities and space. We were lucky cause it was not crowded. Aside from the wellness part I reccommend to visit deer farm and land of fairytales and fantasy (koca pri carovnici)."
3.09.2014,5,Orhidelia - I can only recomend! A pleasant rest for body & soul. We will come back for sure! If you are going to visit Orhidelia with your wife or girlfriend I suggest to book the Romantic Program.
26.08.2014,4,"Stayed 3 nights, weekend included at Sotelia, in a single room. Nice design of the hotel, room had everything needed and was comfortable. 5/5 for design. Although the overall materials used and some details were somehow cheap and not at the quality level requested by the design. 3/5 for building. Had a nice big balcony with view to the front of the hotel, not very spectacular but quite ok.Rooms very overall clean, but not into deep details and corners. 3/5 for cleanliness.A PRO : every day fresh fruits in the room and a bottle of thermal water.Restaurant for breakfast and dinner buffet very crowded and narrow. Feels like school-like cantine not a 4 star superior restaurant. Food also average. You can upgrade your halfboard and eat in the a la carte restaurant, which is not really a la carte because it is having a fixed menu, 2 choices per course, but food is good. Breakfast can me moved to the spa. 4/5 for food, but just because the option of having something different than the buffet.Now coming to services in the hotel, they are really of a 3 stars hotel, not 4 stars superior. Although the lady at the reception was trying to do her best to help me out, there were some glitches. First, at night nobody at the reception, just security, who was very nice and tried to help me out with everything. Second, everything I would like I have to pay extra. Whether I have to upgrade something, or find out some hidden costs. Third, everything closes earlier than scheduled : lobby bar, restaurant, night club Zafran wasn't even open at all. Nobody cared about this. 3/5.(big CON for 4 star hotel - wireless internet is free just for one hour per day).Hotel atmosphere was cold and not customer centered. Somehow it felt industrial and false. Staff needs training and probably management needs training too.Overall hotel is 3/5, although design is excellent.Now coming to spa & wellness.Termalia, which is included in the prices, is crowded, cheap, a lot of kids, very noisy. Categorically not exclusive. Although it has 9 very good saunas with good programmes. I was wondering about cleanliness and hygiene at these... 3/5 for this facility.When it comes to Orhidelia, things get completely different. Very spacious Wellness area, with a very good design, something really special. Very good facilities, light effects, very clean, quiet and with plenty of space for any wishes. Saunas are only 5, but very special, especially the 2 steam baths. (At saunas you can go only without swimsuits). Sauna programmes are also good. You have a restaurant where you can even transfer your breakfast and have it late. Staff polite, but atmosphere still cold and not customer oriented. 5/5 for Orhidelia, it's the most impressive spa I've seen lately. You should although note that access to it costs extra. And you get it with only 2 entrances per day. Costs even more if you want unlimited entrances.Spa Armonia - had only one massage, Olimia massage. Highly recommended. Was very well and kindly treated there. Regards to the masseuse Daniela. I haven't visited other facilities of Terme Olimia.Overall Hotel Sotelia should be 3 stars superior. Orhidelia seems the top wellness center in the region and that saved the overall ranking."
25.08.2014,5,"Monastery - surprising luxury, deer farm, chocolate boutique. The place is so lovely! Easy to find which is not always a case. English texts in the monastery, so you can understand the topic. Deer farm is beyond the monastery 100 m up and chocolate - walk from the monastery to the right if you face it."
20.08.2014,3,"So, there are a few pools, the one with rubbery floors is horribly full of chlorine. Nothing special really, but ok. The restaurant there is horribly expensive in regards to the neighbouring restaurants and the smell off burnt oil carries up to the appartments. Yuck! Put me off my dinner every evening.The one amazing plus were the saunas! WOW! those really are amazing and were not to crowded, also they are pleasantly set, the relaxation areas wonderful, just can't complement them enough!"
31.07.2014,4,"Plenty of pools , water at different temperatures, water falls, whirlpools... Great. Even if there are a lot of people there is plenty of space for everybody!"
15.07.2014,5,"Once a year we visit Terme Olimje. To be more specific, wellness Orhidelia. I do not know, whether the season is the answer, but normally there is not a lot of people. This is good. At such places I hate too many crowd. The spa offers many interesting pools, saunas and Jacuzzi’s. You can take a massage or simply relax by the pool. The spa offers outdoors and indoors locations. Maybe outside there is not enough sun loungers. Everything else is perfect. Inside you have Turkish, infrared, steam saunas. The complex was built 5 years ago, but is still very modern. If you are staying in Terme Olimje, my recommendation is Orhidelia, not Thermalia, where is much bigger crowd."
15.06.2014,4,"Nice to go to Aqualuna open pools with small chilldrens. They have a fun for whole day. We was there for 4 days and daugher asked last day: ""Why we must go to home?"".We'll be back."
16.05.2014,5,AQUALUNA is an amazing aquapark just 3 minutes by car from the centre of Terme Olimia sets in a beautiful nature. There are children's pools which offer many water attractions for children all categories. Our children were so amazed they hadn't time for eating and got a rest for a while. I loved a relaxation pool with massage seats and also pool with waves. There is a tower with a lot of water slides too. There are very pretty statues of jungle animals all over the aquapark. I highly recommend it for families with children.
2.04.2014,5,"Great place to fully charge your batteries. Very nice and peaceful place, with great pool complex.. I've been there with my wife, and we both had a great time."
11.02.2014,5,Fine designed interior with stylish pink-coloured pools and modern rooms and beds for resting. For even better customer experience there is a lot of different saunas and free programs with very kind stuff. Recommended for couples and those with stressful life style.
4.12.2013,1,"Very homophobic institution - when you write in advertising ""exclusively for male-female couples"" you can't justify this as an error. These ""errors"" are unacceptable."
28.10.2013,5,"Superb holiday at Sotelija - Terme Olimia we had this year, as well as all previous ones. Friendly staff, great accommodation and great food are what got us back to the hotel each year. What still needs to specifically commend the wonderful pools Orhidelija we would recommend to everyone. Excellent restaurant in the pool completes the overall impression. Visit this hotel if you really want to relax and enjoy!"
5.10.2013,5,"It is very funny when you read the previous ratings, specially when you read about being forced to put off the clothes when entering the saunas. Spas are an European invention and also reflect a certain life style, to be nude in the sauna is not only perfectly normal, but also important to keep up hygenic standards. The funny thing is, that special people of the country which houses then worlds largest porn industry are showing off to be very shy. The spa and then restaurants are great, the staff is exceptional friendly and even that it's just a little village around the corner, you can do a lot in your pastime. For me Terme Olimia is a very hot location, for private travel, business meetings and as far as I saw, families enjoy the stay here as well. "
4.10.2013,5,"Once I overcame my North American modesty and discomfort about baring it all in front of perfect strangers, this place was pure bliss!This spa complex is nothing like I ever have seen or experienced before. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not dedicate an entire day to enjoy this place.There were more pools, saunas and steam rooms of so many different varieties, you can easily get lost in all of the ways you can relax there.There are also many resting areas, waterbeds, tanning rooms and a restaurant to enjoy some healthy meal options as well as fresh juices.The spa is nicely appointed and clean.I left the Olimia with every ounce of stress having left my body.Go and experience a different level of relaxation!"
7.08.2013,3,"The facilities are very beautiful and modern but in order to go into the Saunas YOU MUST BE NUDE they did not tell us about this rule and they will not make ANY EXCEPTIONS!!! I felt very uncomfortable and kind of tricked because it wasn't until we wanted to go into the saunas and they got our money that they were kicking us out for NOT being nude. The pool is very nice and you are allowed to wear a bathing suit there but I mostly went for the saunas and was very upset I couldn't go unless I went in nude. They were just yelling at me that ""everywhere is same!"" But I have gone to spas in Dominican Republic, U.S, and in Mexico and never was it required to strip down. If that's your thing I'm fine with it but never was I kicked out for wearing a bathing suit and the people were very closed minded and rude."
2.07.2013,5,"i was with my mum, dad and my little brother so it's great for families with little children, my mum and dad were in the sauna we were in the swimming pool which is awesome, there's a gym (but there's special fee for it) and it's lovely, prices are not too high and the whole atmosphere is just stunning :)regards"
3.05.2013,4,"very good, friendly staff, clean water,... If you go to a spa Olimje, you can really relax. in the spa good care of you .. Massages are incredibly good. What to say? You must just visit and see on with own eyes. simply beautiful"
30.04.2013,3,"Orhidelia without doubt is a very nice thermal center, primarily beacause it's architecturally significant and brand new (a couple of years old actually). OK, the surrounding landscape is depressing, but what can one expect from an unsignifficant Slovenian frontier town... I can only hope the management will invest in it's renovation when it starts decaying (the first signs of aging can unfortunately already be seen). It has great pools, great saunas, great relaxation areas that I could give 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the crowds and the awful restaurant.1. do not even think about going there during holidays (especially Easter) unless you want to wander around hopelessly looking for a free bed. Swimming was virtually impossible at that time, saunas so full you had to wait for one person to come out so that you could enter. 99% of guests are Italian and Russian, btw. There should definitely be a maximum number of visitors allowed, like it is in Austria (Bad Blumau for example).2. the so called restaurant serving ""fusion Italian-Asian"" food is hands down the worst place I have ever eaten in in 20 years. I was ashamed to be Slovenian after having finished (left most of) my portion of overcooked spaghetti observing Italian guests' face expressions while tasting theirs. I really felt sorry for them. The soup was supposed to be an ""oriental soup with pineapple and shrimps"". What I got was a clear fatty beef soup with three shrunken shrimps floating in it and 5 micro pieces of pineapple. I could not believe my eyes (not to mention the taste!). If you do get hungry, the desserts and coffee are admittedly not that bad. They really need to fire their chef as soon as possible! And it wouldn't hurt the waiters to smile either."
8.04.2013,5,"What to say? You must visit Orhidelia and relax. This is all you need! ( but i need also to add some characters to my description so it can be published, but i don't know what also can be said, just exillent! )"
1.04.2013,5,"Orchidelia is a part of Terme Olimia, it is newly built, amazingly beautiful and professional wellness, 9 saunas, coolest relaxing areas I have seen in a spa, water beds, bean begs etc... And it's not that expensive actually, because it feels so good after you've been there. True adventure I must say"
12.02.2013,5,"Welness center Orhidelia is the star of Terme Olimia, we keep returning at this oasis of peace, harmony and well being. Perfect battery charging get away."
5.11.2012,5,"There is just no better spa experience than Terme Olimia. Terme Olimia offers one of the best wellness experiences in Slovenia. Their “Orhidelia” world of thermal pleasures has already won numerous awards and was among 11 finalists at the World Architecture Festival 2009 in category Holiday and is the most beautiful and wonderfull wellnes. The hotel, Spa, pools – all is wonderful, but the staff is what makes it all run well and is unbelievably helpful and accomodation. You will definitely want to revisit again and again. We will for shore."
29.10.2012,5,"There is just no better spa experience than Terme Olimia. Here you can relax in a new built part of the huge complex, which offers several different saunas, watter beds, jaccusys, restaurant, bar, open pools. When in indoor pools they pleasant ambient music. Even if you dive under watter you will hear the music - the one they play just under watter. The new complex got reward as one of the best 8 architectual achievements in the world for the year 2009. You will definitely want to revisit again and again."
12.09.2012,2,"As we were in the neighbourhood yesterday (100 km away) from Terme Olimia and had the whole day free, my boyfriend and I decided to go for a swim in Wellness Orhidelia. At first we wanted to make a reservation and stay over the night but we had to give up because of urgent obligations the next day.We came there around 10 a.m. and saw that we even can't go in the Terme because the entrance road was under construction.The road workers made us park the car across. We came in to buy the tickets and my boyfriend accidentaly saw some note on the desk that said that the indoor pools of Orhidelia are being cleaned for 3 days and can't be used then. We could only enter outdoor pools and saunas for a price that was only under 20% discount due to cleaning. The price of 22€ per person (with discount)was too much for us to use just 3 pools so we turned around and left.It would be OK that we didn't made 200 kilometers over bumpy country roads trough the villages of Slovenia and their smells of manure just because Terme Olimia couldn’t put on their web site that they are in the three day pool cleaning process.It is a good thing that we didn’t made the reservations for the night because we would absolutely go insane. I think they could clean the pools in one day, maximum two, if they worked during the night.. And being so big and “famous” they could arrange that the entrance is being fixed at the time their guests don’t need to wait at the entrance/exit to get in and out."
26.06.2012,5,"We (2 adults and 2 small kids) stayed in Terme Olimija 1 night in June 2012. To be honest, I was quite curious about this place, because I have heart a lot (there were some TV Shows about this place in Slovakia) but nobody from my friends nor relatives have ever visited Terme Olimia. Reviews on tripadvisor.com were good so I decided to go. Terme Olimia are quite big complex. I have not seen it all - because there was not time (1 day is not enough) and therefore I can only write about few places: Hotel Sotelia (see my review there), Wellness Orchidelija, Wellness Termalija, Restaurant (Goscisce) Lipa.Wellness Orchidelija - Top of the class wellness. It is really nice and luxurious Wellness center (purple color prevails). Nice relaxing music, whirlpool, kid's pool (0.5m water), bar and luxurious leather deck-chairs. Water in all pools has above 30 degrees of Celsius but you have to pay extra to get in.Wellness Termalia - nice wellness all in blue tones (blue swimming pools). You can expect a lot of people here because it is used free of charge by 3 hotels (included in a price of the room) Hotel Sotelia, Hotel Breza and Aparthotel Rosa. There are even 2 slides for kids. One is for very small children (up to 4 years) and the second one is for older kids. You can find there 7 pools (if not more) with water above 30 degrees of Celsius.Restaurant Lipa - this is small restaurant on a tiny square in Terme Olimia. I can recommend it, mainly ""Mushroom soup in bread cup"" and great dessert Gibanica.I was not expecting anything so maybe therefore my impression was so great. I believe that we will visit this place again. If you are reading this and considering whether to go or not, do not hesitate and go. But when you are booking, try to get some package and get to Orchidelija free of charge."
26.12.2011,4,"We were at Terme Olimia in December for three days and it was excellent. The pools, the jacuzzi, the waterfall from the roof, lights, saunas, massages, everything was very very good. Nice people and very tasty food.We specialy love the bags left for us on the bed with towels in it, and bath rope.We'll come back."
15.12.2011,5,"Wanna feel like a beauty queen? Just go to Terme Olimia. There is beautiful nature in village Podèetrtek. High quality services, a lot of facillitis inside and outside hotel complex. Nice walking, cycling, hiking , swiming, eating, drinking....everything for good rest on holidays."
7.12.2011,4,"We went there to spent the afternoon with friends - couples. For three hours we payed 30 EUR/person. Saunas were already included, there are few different swimming pools, places to rest, room with water beds, bio sauna, infra suna, finnish and turkish, steam..you can also go for a massage, but that day all were full at the time when we came. Just dont go to the ""old part"". It looks very bad actually and we regret that we went there to take a look, but o.k., we were all alone in 1 swimming pool there. In the bar you can get also some cakes or sandwiches."
25.03.2015,5,"So this is a review about Wellness Orhidelia, part of Terme Olimia. It's the newer part of the complex and a really fancy one.Big pools with underwater music (yes, you read that right), there are 5 or 6 saunas, IR, finnish, turkish...They have a lot of quiet resting places, with big beds for 2 people, there is also a room with water beds.Everything is really modern, ""fancy"" if you would like to call it like that.It's not on the cheap end, but definitly worth the visit if you are nearby.Would give it 10 stars if that was possible :D"
22.03.2015,5,"We've been in the new part of this spa, named Orhidelia, about ten times and the only problem is that when you visit this place once you don't want to go anywhere else! So we did! Relaxation for body and soul in the beautiful and modern designed interior with friendly staff. It's hard to talk about experience in this place with words. You must feel it by visiting this place!"
5.03.2015,5,"We stayed at the Sotelia hotel for a weekend, enjoying their spa center, saunas, whirlpools and good food. The rooms are very nice, clean, enjoyable. Lots of choices from dinner menu. The price is very fair for the offered. Look for actions/specials on their website."
16.02.2015,5,"This spa is the best place for winter relaxation. All pools are warm, water clean, beds comfortable. The staff is kind and welcoming. The spa is big so you can do different things each day - swim, go to sauna, get massage, sleep etc. I like the lavender color which is the main color of all the facilities, so soothing...There's an entrance fee, you're given a chip bracelet so you can move freely and forget about carrying the wallet. If you're a guest of one of the nearby hotels, your fee is a bit lower.Also there are many walking paths around the complex you can use and see the castle, the Podcetrtek town or some other landmarks. If the weather is nice, got to one of cafes in Podcetrtek and enjoy the sunshine!"
10.02.2015,5,"I am regular guest of Terme Olimia because the staff is very friendly, it is very clean and well organized (no cash required within complex). Wellcard lotalty programm is excellent for regular guests.Tipically I visit Termalia and Sauna World a few times a month for pleasant relaxation. I try not miss any sauna programmes which are held by Slovenia's best sauna professionals. Termalia offers indoor and outdoor pools with water attractions and self service restaurant. You and your children will have full day of water fun at affordable price.When I want luxury and space - I strech my wallet a bit for Orchidelia. It is a mix of indoor and outdoor pools, spas and saunas, very good on-pool restaurant, large lockers and private shower rooms. Entry fee includes bathrobe and towel. Key word is space, a lot of space and self-pampering. Try not to miss free of charge sauna programs. No textile friday evenings (FKK) and late night working hours on fridays and saturdays (open till midnight).Massages in Termalia and Orchidelia are really excellent. Try house specials - especially Amala and Vitae.TIP: On the bottom of any receipt will find Wi-Fi code for ine hour of Internet. Acommodation offer is also rich here. Hotels Sotelia and Breza offer variety of standards and designs. If you like apartments, I can also recommend staying in Olimia.Surroundings offer interesting sites for walking and hiking, chocolate factory and other gastronomic delights. I haven't visited summer complex Aqualuna. It is on my to-do. :)"
7.02.2015,5,Orhidelia spa is for sure the perfect jem if you need a relaxing day for the soul and body. They have for the best saunas in Slovenia. The arhitecture inside the saunas is amazing and the teraphies they offer are the best i ever tried. I recomend this place a lot!
7.01.2015,4,"We stayed in Therme Olimia (Sotelia) for three nights. I enjoyed it. It was a lovely combination of walks, breathing and relaxing in pools and saunas. Our room was spacious and cozy, with everything needed - slippers, gowns, nice cosmetics, convenient shower. I did not like the pillows though, they were flat and a bit untidy, it felt like many people have used them before..And pieces of soap provided were really tiny, ridiculosely small! The breakfast is really rich and various! It included interesting local dishes, like cottage cheese with truffle oil, etc. I was surprised, that there was a queue to get coffee (by the way, coffee was not tasty).Dinner buffet is delicious as well, I can recommend it.In the evening there was nice live music in Barago bar.The pool territory in Termalia is huge! We especially enjoyed swimming outside - unbelievably relaxing and real fun! The water is warm enough not to feel uncomfortably cold.The sauna world impressed me - I have rather big experience in SPA resorts, but have never seen so many types of saunas!! Maybe even too much - it takes special time to remember everything and realize, where to go, and try most of them.I was delighted with the bracelet system - if you forget the number of your box, it reminds. Complete relax!We were not ready to see so many naked men in saunas. There was a contrast: families with kids in pools, and mostly men without underwear in saunas. Feels like you came here by mistake. Confusing.The hotel is good, but there is not much to see and do near it. For three-five days - perfect, but not more. "
5.12.2014,4,"The best Hotel-Sotelia. The best SPA Orhidelia.The worst possible restaurant - Restavracija Lipa. Beef carpacio with no taste, beef stake that should be medium rare totally overcooked, after the dinner we smelt like eating in the wordt olace possible.."
22.11.2014,5,"We're regularly going and enjoying the spa, wellness and pools facilities in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Slovenia, but have never been in anything similar to Orhidelia section of Terme Omelia. I don't know for the rest of the complex, but the Orhidelia spa is the one of its kind and the place I will visit on regular basis (4.5 hours of regular drive from Belgrade) with my girlfriend whenever I have the opportunity for it.My only recomendation is that - although there is a more general area on the ground floor for the whole families - this place, especially on the first floor, is just for the couples only who would like to relax from the everyday life and to enjoy in the fabolous ambient, unique architecture and the beautiful and spacious spa contents. And, first of all, in his/her loving one."
6.10.2014,5,"This is the best spa I have ever seen. Purple shades in the pool area, oval and separated pools with warm thermal water give you the impresion of isolation and your own private time. Here you could chose between two wellness and spa area - one more luxury, peaceful and intimate, and the other one dedicated to the family full with water atractions."
5.01.2015,4,"very nice spa, with great choices of inner and outer pools, sauna and relax. Interesting dar grey mineral water pool with both in and outside pool is an interesting experience"
19.10.2014,2,"The Terme 3000 complex was a below average experience. Outdated infrastructure but somewhat friendly personal. We asked about the saunas, and were told there are 4 of them. We found out only 3 working and all of them in bad conditions. Inappropriate loud pop music in the saunas too... Definitely not coming again!"
14.09.2014,2,We visited terme last year on our family vacation. We visited many times before and never had any problems. This time we were not as satisfied. We were using indoor pools and there was only one open. All outside pools were closed and also kids pools were all closed. We paid full price for only 40% of service that was offered. We did stay there in September and it was still warm so there was no need for pools to be closed. We contacted term 300 thru email but never got any responses. That will make us think twice before we ever decide to go back.The biggest issue was that we came there with 3 small children. All that they could do is to let us know that only one pool was open so we could then decide if is it really worth the money since it's so expensive for family of 5. Their staff should be little more educated how to deal with customers. If they did tell us that there is reno inside we would be ok as long as we knew and not be surprised after we entered the spa.
1.09.2014,4,"It was not crowded and the water seemed clean, although it had a lot of chlorine in it.There are enough attractions to be entertained for the better part of the day.Behind the pool area there is a very nice grassy area with shade of trees where one can lay down and sunbathe or lay in the shade."
15.09.2013,4,You have a lote to swim in the pool inside. From warmiest to caller. The watter is not so deep. They are clean enough. But htey will renovate all pool and the building too.total they are 6 pool inside and 2 are open to the outside.
30.08.2013,3,"We stayed at other hotel facility but went to Terme 3000 for swimm as they have more attractions for kids. It was overcrowded. All the armchairs were taken. Also the cleanliness was not at it's best. Probably part of the problem was, that it was not very warm outside so all the guests stayed indoors."
16.08.2013,3,"This is an old complex that has been extended over the year with new facilities. It's primary a hotel and therefore everything from a small hamburger on is almost double priced.I can't say that I've seen the whole resort, but what I've seen has been there for at lest 30 years. Mostly everything is old and needs to be replaced except the new swimming pool and slides area.A big plus is the jump pool, there is a pool that is solely meant for people to jump in! And It works, no one is jumping into the other pools.Also phenomenal: the huge variety of pools there! You have thermal inside and outside pool, spas, 30°C pool, 25°C pools, huge kids pool, slides only pool, river+mini slide pool, jumping pool. And those a lovely divided between inside and outside. And somehow people took the schemata that the old part of the resort is for older people that like it more silent and so there is the is the relax and silent part. The new resort with slides is loud from joyful scream and is so more populated by kids and younger folks.The food. I was there once and ate only once therfore, one hamburger that stank. The Slama Šank, that is in the middle of the grass field is horrible, although the mark they are selling by is amazing if bought and grilled at home. Absolutely would not recommend. The first restaurant that you see when you enter the resort has that old 20 years ago smell, but I don't how the food is. The 3rd is in the slides building and is provided by a big Slovenian market, it sells pizzas and so on. This one might be the safest bet. Maybe.The slides are amazing. Huge variety for little Slovenia. You can try: mini children slide, fast long open slides, dark with led slides, rocket almost 90° slide, a c. 70° slide and the usual whirl y slide. For outdoor deckchairs you have to pay, indoor deckchairs are for free.I'd recommended for younger people and people with children, and also for older senior people, there are areas literally for every generation there.Just I hope they will renovate the old part in the next years."
10.08.2013,5,"We spend 4 days there, and I must say it was excellent. If you do not want to spend your whole day in the water, there are well marked bicycling paths, good restaurants and a wonderfull wellness center. We stayed in one of the holiday houses appended to the hotel complex and love it. The whole complex of vacation homes looks wonderful, it is clean, the tennis grounds are well taken care of, so are the pools and water slides. I loved ""the rocket"", definitly got my adrenaline going there! Worth visiting for a few days, to relax, to unwind and to have some fun and I am sure we will be going back!"
20.07.2013,4,"The waterpark has some water slides, it's clean and not noisy. The best thing about it is that it features a unique water slide called Aqualoop, other than that other water slides are available in pretty much every waterpark. The queues on slides were quite long too."
5.06.2013,4,"The area is enourmous and quite nice for families with children, who want to have a good time in the pool. I have been visiting the place for the past 20 years with my family and they are trying hard to keep a high standard. I've been to all three hotels and like Ajda the most."

4.04.2015,4,Very nice hotel with friendly staff and great food. The prices are reasonable and I particularly like the surroundings - the park with the creeks and a loot of green area. The castle Otoèec is really close - ideal for a short trip to this landmark.
17.11.2014,4,"I have been to hotel Smarjetna last weekend. And it was great.The staff is super friendly, the room was great. The swimming pool is not new, but is ok, I love the Jacuzzi. We also went to try the couple bath and was great. Just to make my day perfect I also try classic massage and the positively surprised me. Massage was just the way it suppose to be.I was also surprised about the breakfast, they have many Eco food and healthy food to choose from. I was amazed. My partner went to try sauna and he was so happy afterwards, he said this is the best saunas he ever been to. He loved the chocolate sauna.I would recommend Šmarješke toplice to everyone, young and old. Their service is super great."
16.10.2014,3,"1. Was here for 3 nights in a tourist group2. Food was low quality, not fresh, and selection poor (both breakfast and supper).

Air conditioning deliberately not functioning (autumn?!? winter?!?)5. Towels worn out,"" micro-soap"" provided (really) that we could not really use, and had to buy soap and shampoo from local supermarket (quite strange for a 4-star hotel)6.

27.06.2014,4,"I was in this hotel on April this year, and I have to say that is very good hotel for reasonable price. Hotel doesn't look like a new one, but is really good! Rooms are large and clean, the hotel restaurant is very good with abeautifull view, staff very friendly and helpfull and area around hotel is totally amazing! It's pitty, that I was there just for few days, and I didn't have enought time for spa, but maybe next time I will try to do something something else. I think for this price standar of hotel is really good!"
8.05.2014,5,Many times staying in this hotel complex without any objections. Šmajerske toplice is certainly one of the best places in Slovenia for vacation with many activities. Exelent saunas and very good meals
18.07.2013,4,"We stayed in Hotel Smarjeta for the second time, very nice overall experience. The hotel is the oldest one so be sure to book the Vitaruim hotel, the newest addition to the complex - rooms may have internet access also (we did not have one at all). The nature is absolutely beautiful, easy for biking or hiking. The outdoor thermal pools are well maintained (28 to 32 degrees C), we especially liked the oldest, wooden one just on top of the thermal well. The staff was helpful, as always. The food was so-so, but sometimes they surprised us nicely for dinner. Our rooms were quite basic with old furniture and outdated bathroom but we did not mind (except for uncomfortable mattresses). Excellent spa and medical centre!A visit to the nearby Otocec castle is a must, just for lunch or afternoon tea - bring your camera!"
21.05.2013,4,"Šmarješke toplice are surrounded by a lot of greenery, the pictures on the website are not different from real ones. The hotel is pleasant and the staff is more then friendly. They have a complex of 2 hotels, both with four stars and I think that anyone who wants a vacation or just a one-day reprieve must visit Šmarješke toplice. Especially those who love nature"
27.09.2012,3,"My husband & I traveled to Slovenia for our friends wedding. This hotel was one of a few suggested by the bride & while I am showing it as a 3 I would say it is more a 3 1/2.The reception, information & spa staff are very helpful & friendly & look to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The location of this hotel is beautiful, quiet & really allows guests to clear their minds. The first day both my husband & I enjoyed massages in the spa, they were both excellent & we were shocked by the reasonable price. We enjoyed the thermal pools but were a little uncomfortable with the ""no clothing rule"" when it is not a private setting. Staff in the pool reception could be better informed & a little more friendly.Housekeeping staff were generally unfriendly & somewhat inflexible with their cleaning schedule. While the beds in the room are comfortable, the pillows are not - lumpy & almost seem to be at the end of their life. Restaurant staff are friendly & helpful. Selection at breakfast is a nice variety & dinner was a nice selection of Slovenian dishes.Overall our stay was very nice but new pillows would provide a much better sleep, sort of a big plus when the facility is all about wellness."
16.08.2012,4,"We had great results after staying in the hotel for 10 nightsA very good program for both detox and slim-fitNice facilities for cardio etc,good massages etc and also a nice swimming poolI should recommand to book a program including all treatmentsWe flew to Zagreb and they also arranged a 1 hour transfer by taxiThere could be some more intertainment for tourists in the eveningThe rooms are nice but I should recommand to renovate the groundfloor especially the restaurantsI appreciated that there was free internret excess ( with a cable ) in the rooms"
4.05.2012,4,"Excelent hotel, excelent location for people who like nature, forest, flowers.. very peacefull. Also i recomend you to chek diferent treatemens for spine, other bones, hart etc etc.. they have great experts.unfortunatelly the don't have any kind of activites for children.Breakfast is fantastic- eco. Dinner is prepared infront, which i don't like it."

21.05.2013,4,"Šmarješke toplice are surrounded by a lot of greenery, the pictures on the website are not different from real ones. The hotel is pleasant and the staff is more then friendly. They have a complex of 2 hotels, both with four stars and I think that anyone who wants a vacation or just a one-day reprieve must visit Šmarješke toplice. Especially those who love nature"
27.09.2012,3,"My husband & I traveled to Slovenia for our friends wedding. This hotel was one of a few suggested by the bride & while I am showing it as a 3 I would say it is more a 3 1/2.The reception, information & spa staff are very helpful & friendly & look to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The location of this hotel is beautiful, quiet & really allows guests to clear their minds. The first day both my husband & I enjoyed massages in the spa, they were both excellent & we were shocked by the reasonable price. We enjoyed the thermal pools but were a little uncomfortable with the ""no clothing rule"" when it is not a private setting. Staff in the pool reception could be better informed & a little more friendly.Housekeeping staff were generally unfriendly & somewhat inflexible with their cleaning schedule. While the beds in the room are comfortable, the pillows are not - lumpy & almost seem to be at the end of their life. Restaurant staff are friendly & helpful. Selection at breakfast is a nice variety & dinner was a nice selection of Slovenian dishes.Overall our stay was very nice but new pillows would provide a much better sleep, sort of a big plus when the facility is all about wellness."
16.08.2012,4,"We had great results after staying in the hotel for 10 nightsA very good program for both detox and slim-fitNice facilities for cardio etc,good massages etc and also a nice swimming poolI should recommand to book a program including all treatmentsWe flew to Zagreb and they also arranged a 1 hour transfer by taxiThere could be some more intertainment for tourists in the eveningThe rooms are nice but I should recommand to renovate the groundfloor especially the restaurantsI appreciated that there was free internret excess ( with a cable ) in the rooms"
4.05.2012,4,"Excelent hotel, excelent location for people who like nature, forest, flowers.. very peacefull. Also i recomend you to chek diferent treatemens for spine, other bones, hart etc etc.. they have great experts.unfortunatelly the don't have any kind of activites for children.Breakfast is fantastic- eco. Dinner is prepared infront, which i don't like it."
18.03.2015,4,"The room with balcony was nice, modern, spacious and clean. We had half board, the food was excellent. Friendly staff. The pool area we didn't like much, too crowded, slippery floor around indoor pools."
22.02.2015,4,"in short:Hotel: modern, chic, good food, also bio breakfastThe only thing which should improve is service in bar. A bit slow and confusingArea: good place for biking, running, walking aroundWellness: not to big, bet very nice, with saunas and nice Japanese spa"
22.02.2015,4,"This was our third, or maybe even fourth time in this resort. Unfortunately, this time it was so crowded that the impression was not so good as before. The main thing that went wrong was the wellness part because the saunas and pools just could not take so many people! I think there should be some restriction, i.e. when the number of people comes to a point when there are no more available deck chairs, the staff should do something about it (in some hotels you have to book the period of time you want to spend in the sauna). We actually paid for the saunas but were not able to use them for the time we planned to. Another thing is the food. Breakfast and dinner were fine but lunch was not up to the standard of a 4- star superior hotel."
10.02.2015,5,"This hotel is nice, clean and comfortable. The spa is not so great for relaxing, but for swimming and playing in the pool it's ok.Staff ios friendly, breakfast buffet is very good and the half board is extremely affordable."
20.01.2015,4,"It was our third visit to the hotel and as usual we found virtually everything excellent. We did had a couple of problems to begin with but they were resolved after speaking to the manager. We do enjoy the warm pools and the spa facilities. The hotel is situated amongst the most beautiful countryside with rolling hills covered with broad-leaf forest - the autumn colours are magnificent. Usually we drove from France(1500km each way) but discovered on our last visit that they now offer a transfer service from the airport. That meant a longer stay at the hotel and we arrived a lot more relaxed.One thing we did this time that was a new experience was to learn how to walk properly with Nordic walking sticks (I had just bought a pair)There are regular walks organised by the hotel also.I have back problems and decided to try out the medical centres specialist treatment for back pain. I booked a 6 day course. I was examined by a doctor who spoke English and specialised in rehabilitation medicine and she prescribed the relevant treatment for my case. This involved various treatments including physio and specialist pool exercises. The staff were always very professional, well qualified and friendly. My back has been a lot better since. We tend to drink a fair amount of tea and coffee throughout the day and it would be nice if tea and coffee facilities were offered in the room.WiFi is now installed through the hotel which is an improvement on the slow LAN service offered previously. However although our room was about 2m from the aerial in the corridor the signal didn't penetrate well into the bedroom and at the desk where my netbook was, it was very poor. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked to go back in March. Maybe we will find a kettle in the room!"
6.01.2015,5,"everything here is excellent, the food, the pool, the sauna, the jacuzzi, the rooms, the staff....everything! the prise was correct and the hotl have also internet, wi-fi, and thats awesome.i would like to come back! thank you :)"

8.12.2014,5,"This was our third time staying at Balnea and we can't get enough of what the suite has to offer. We stayed two nights and spent most of the time relaxing in the jacuzzi with the fireplace warming up the place. We enjoyed the complimentary tea and fruit very much and love how clean and neat they keep the place. Breakfast was very good, healthy choice and alot to choose from. Also the dinners were a good choice, everything we had was so tasty! I would say the only thing I didn't enjoy is the bed. It is fairly uncomfortable, just like in the previous suite we stayed in. I hope maybe until next time we come to stay the beds in suites will be as pleasant as everything else in this amazing hotel."
3.12.2014,4,"friendly and involved staff; excellent food with a glass of local wine; buffet breakfast with plenty of choice for even the most demanding; affordable and comfortable wellness services; excellent sauna can be a little small for the amount of people and ther is no outdoor whirlpools; pools are everything you expect at a spa - but not something special; Room is the perfect modern design including the bathroom and balcony, quiet surroundings, far from the city bustle"
24.11.2014,5,"I was in this hotel durring the business trip, and unfortunatelly I didn't have time for spa, but believe me, next time, when I'll visit Slovenja, I will stay longer in this hotel definitely! The hotel is new,rooms are really big, and luxurious, and inside hotel is very good restaurant. The food in this restaurant is really delicious! Staff is very friendly and helpful. It was pleasure to stay in this hotel."
2.10.2014,5,"If you want peaceful and quiet this must be the hotel. In the woods so tranquil. It is also a wellness centre with heated poools, saunas etc. The roooms are spotless and a good size. The buffet style meals are healthy and good quality. Very good breakfast , loved the fresh sweet pineapple.Easy car parking. Just some small problems with English, but you can get by. Free internet computer and free bikes - the area is very flat for good cycling. It is a first rate resort."
12.09.2014,5,"Visiting this hotel for the first time but for sure not the last!!!!!We are looking farward allready to come back!!!!We stayed 7 days and enjoyed every moment!!!The room was spacious and well equiped,the service, the choise of food in the restaurant,the bar,the entertainment and for sure the Spa sevices were Superb!!!!!We were with a couple of friends and it was a perfact vacation!!!!!The staff all over the hotel was polite and helpfull,the atmosphere was very relaxing,the pools were very clean and pleasant-and we were more than pleased!!!!!We met a couple who come s back every year-ten years by now-and we understand why! !!!!Wish to come back soon!!!!!"
17.08.2014,5,"Visiting an hotel for the fifth time means we feel very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere there. Not only the accomodation is superb, but the service, staff, restaurant, choice of foods, drinks, desserts- everything is just excellent, including the coffee.Beds are very comfortable, everything is very, very clean. Swimming pools are also clean, water is relaxing. Recommend swimming during Fridays and Saturdays with the night swimming, until 11 PM.Recommendation for the families with children; kids just adore this hotel."
15.08.2014,5,"we stayed in Hotel Balnea Superior 7 nights, we enjoy every moment of our staying, the welcome was warm friendly and efficient, the staff are polite and speak good english, the room was big, comforteble and clean, the food was very tasty and served to the table, the SPA treatments was excellent and relexed, very good disable accessible any where in the hotel and out side, fantastic warm water pools. we will certain come back!"
24.07.2014,2,"Too expensive for children - in my case no discount for children under 10 years old - rude staff...I would never go back, if it was not for my dauthers medical treatments...food was the same...pork in 100 difrent ways, desserts not for sweet tooth...i liked the room...very clean... In hotel bar no newspapers or just the ones forgotten by guests"
10.07.2014,4,"The rooms are very modern and comfortable (we stayed in a suite that was excellent), the service is very friendly, but most of the stuff speaks only poor English. The spa is very good but not excellent. There is no Wi-Fi, except in the lobby"
31.05.2014,4,"Hotel is amazing with his large room and also a balcony. Our room looked to the mountain. In our bathroom we have a masagge bath. All it was great, clean, warm enough. We travel in time where it was a little cold outside. Nice thing is that with bad wheather you can rich all pool without walking out. There is a tunell to rich 2 of 3 warm pool .(35,36°). Welnes center is not so far. A few minute on a large hall and you are there. People is amazing, friendly and always smiling and trying to fill you good all the time."
8.05.2014,5,"The Balnea Hotel is a pure joy to stay at. It is definitely the most comfortable and cleanest hotel we've been to. The staff is very friendly, especially the waitress and waiter in the lobby bar.I hope they will sort out the wellness pool problems that other reviewers mention.But the hotel itself remains a clear winner!"
28.04.2014,5,"This is a great place when visiting this part of Slovenia. The hotel is modern, the rooms are modern, the bathrooms are modern, the lobby is very contemporary.I enjoyed the walk from the main building to the spa area, it is very dramatic ( specially in the evening with the lights on).The spa is what makes this place superb. Make sure that you have enough of time to use it! There is a running track outside of the hotel which takes you through really nice woodlands and fields back to the hotel. ( it starts not far from the large parking space).The breakfast is ridiculously healthy!!! I mean this as a compliment! I love this place, simple as that!"
10.04.2014,5,Hotel in modern design and frendly staff. We stayed 4 days in february after weather disaster in Slovenia. We spend some beatutifull days. Food is excellent. For breakfast you can drink fresh juice and eat a lot of bio and eco foods.We get more than we expect.
4.03.2014,4,"Hotel is great, spa staff and treatments are very disappointing and are not up to the price charged as staff is not professional as in other european hotel SPAs... the problem that hotel has is slippery floor around indoor pools where you can se children and adults falling all the time and slipping when walking around, hotel failed to put matt non slippery tiles on floors SO BE CAREFUL. My daughter fell 3 times and hurt her knees and another child fell on head and she was bleeding there. The hotel should do something about it! Also the hotel pool is always crowded with local people which is not so pleasant as pool becomes overcrowded and too busy. Local people also eat sandwiches they bring with themselves and this should not happen in 4**** hotel, specially when you pay room per night 180 euros. Right?"
26.02.2014,5,"How relaxing..to just soak in that jacuzzi in that beautiful room, with the warmth of the fireplace in the room...clean neat bathroom with a modern walk in rain shower. Two TV-s one you can watch from the bed or bath and other in the living space. We already were in this hotel but in a different suite. They are both similar, but for me this suite (Suite Maria) had an uncomfortable bed. My partner however said he didn't find the bed uncomfortable. The breakfast was great but the dinners weren't that good. We stayed for two nights during our stay we visited the Balnea wellnes and we took a Zeus bath for an hour which was such a pleasure. Also we got a massage which my partner enjoyed more than I did. I liked the fact that after the therapy you sit around and make yourself a cup of tea. Oweral we loved it and will come again but only if the suites are available, they are amazing."
16.02.2014,5,"Hotel Balnea is a really excellent place for a weekend at a spa. Ultra cool interior design, four star quality throughout and great staff. The spa is well laid out, lots of amenities including all types of steam and sauna, indoor and outdoor pools, Japanese hot pool and so on."
3.02.2014,5,"We spent 3 nights here, wonderful suite with private fireplace and jacuzzi. Nice furniture and friendly staff. Rich breakfast while dinnner is on average. Suggested the hotel to install WiFi in the room, only cable connection available."
13.01.2014,3,"We were there in the end of November 13, 3 rainy days.The hotel is beautiful, rooms well equiped, staff-most of them profis.Variety, both for breakfast and dinner should be wider-expected for 4 superior hotel.There is something, that can not fit together-4s star hotel with wellness part, opened for whole crowd(daily ticket for cca.10 EUR) not just for guests.It is expected, when you pay the price, they have, that you ll get some comfort also in pools.Nope, mission impossible.Opened also for 'sheeps'....There are not a lot of chances to see me there again...."
3.01.2014,3,"My and my family visit this pool last weekend. Not really too satisfied. Their website does not give you correct information about prices. The tiles are always soo wet and slippery that is really very dangerous when you walk around the pool. Water in the pool is quite hot, but this is why you choose a Spa:)Bottom line - it is better to choose other SPA in Slovenia...."
8.11.2013,5,"Having stayed at The Hotal Balnea last year we just had to go back this year if only for the relaxing experience of swimming in warm pools, eating good food, staying in a lovely spacious room with a beautiful view. The hotel is situated in a small but thriving village surrounded by broad-leafed woodlands which offer miles of walking.We booked directly with the hotel and got a special autumn offer which gave us unlimited access to the Oasis, which is the area with various saunas and steam rooms. This was fantastic and was even more relaxing than our stay last year. It was our wedding anniversary treat to ourselves. We requested and got the same room as last year, we received a half bottle of local sparkling wine and a plate of fruit which was a lovely touch.We were welcomed by Alenka who remembered us which was very nice. It is good to see that so many of the staff are still working there. We were delighted to see the Trip Advisor award prominently and proudly displayed behind the reception desk.Reading the review by Patunya G we cannot understand what the problem with the pools was. There are 3 pools attached to the Hotel Vital (linked underground to the Balnea) these are 36C and lovely to just wallow in. Attached by a covered walkway to the Balnea is the wellness centre which has a big pool indoors going to an outside one. In the summer there is another big outdoor pool. the pools at the Wellness centre are 32C, all pools have Jacuzzi jets etc. The Oasis spa is also situated here as well as a huge suite of rooms for all sorts of treatments such as massages, facials etc. The water in all the pools comes out of the ground at 36C and is well known for its therapeutic properties, particularly for people with movement problems.Don't go here if you want to lose weight as there is so much variety of food on offer, however they do have main course healthy option choice as well as an excellent and varied vegetarian dish every night.We are already planning our trip there for next year!"
12.09.2013,5,"We stayed a week at the hotel, enjoying the SPA & services- absolutely wonderful As it was our 40th wedding annivesary we looked for a quiet & relaxing place - we found it ... The suite we received was excellent, pampering to all our needsI will definetely recommend this hotel"
11.09.2013,5,The room was luxurious and pampering. We had a king sized bed a great balcony with beautiful countryside view. We received bathrobes and could wear them all the time back and forth from the hotel to the connected spa area which was great.the heated swimming pools were so great and we took a massage which was good too.we also were offered a nice dinner for just 10 euros per person. We were celebrating our 20 years anniversary and this hotel was just the right place
30.03.2013,4,"We stayed in a superior suite with a jacuzzi in room and fire place, two flat screen TV-s and, balcony, a real modern bathroom. One of the best things are the many lights in the room that make SUCH a good atmosphere also you can adjust intensity of the lights. Rooms are thoroughly cleaned every day. All in all this is a very modern hotel. The cleaning ladies and the waiters were very friendly. On the other hand the receptionist was realy unfriendly and looked bored to death. The meals, especially breakfast was outstanding. So much choice! You can have the cook make fresh eggs and such right infront of you.The down side is the pool. There are two, one worse than the other. We haven't visited the spa, but heard only good about it."
5.12.2012,4,"I was here with my boyfriend for a romantic weekend. The room was large and well designed, the bathroom is amazing and the toilette is separatly. We had also a hot tub in the bathroom. The pillow was to soft and uncomfortable. Our room was od the first floor and the view from the balcony was't very nice, We had half boards. The quality of food is amazing, a lot of choise.. you have a self service breakfast with a lot of choise, the dinner was also self service (the soup, salat and dessert), the main meal was bring from the waiter. You can choise three main meals (traditional, welness and vegetarian). On saturday I was very surprise because they prepare a gala dinner with candle and live music, the menu was also different but still very good.I like a lot the corridor that connects the hotel and the pools, so you can go with bathrobe to the pools, sauna and SPA center. The sauna was great and I really like the resting rooms with waterbads. The pools was amazing at night (on weekends it's open until 23 o'clock, also the sauna) and there was a lot of candles, so the atmosphere was so romantic. The staff was also very friendly and willng to help. We didn't find a parking place near the hotel, but they have also another parking with ramp (it was a 2 minutes distance from the hotel).We will definitly return."
30.10.2012,5,"We first visited Dolenjske Toplice in 2005 and stayed on the campsite belonging to the hotel group. Then as part of the camp fees we were allowed 3 hours a day in the warm pools. We promised ourselves we would return one day.Eventually in 2012 we returned, this time to have the comfort of the new Balnea Hotel - opened 2008.The hotel is well designed, large spacious rooms, friendly staff, excellent food, partly self service from the vast choice available on the buffets with a choice of main course served by the restaurant staff. If you are vegetarian don't worry you will be well catered for.There is no WiFi in the rooms but a cable was provided for connection to the hotel LAN. WiFi was available in reception and in most areas on the ground floor - so if you have a smart phone/iPad or similar you won't be able to access the web in your room.One small niggle - no tea/coffee making facilities in the room would be lovely to be able to have a cuppa as and when instead of having to go to the coffee bar on the ground floor. Also you are not allowed to take you own kettle as the hotel info says no electrical appliances!! We survived without.The unlimited access to the warm thermal pools is wonderful, our package allowed us a days free entry into the sauna. Here there are steam rooms, saunas, Japanese bath etc. There is also a wide variety of cosmetic treatments available as well many types of massage available. Also there is a fully equipped medical centre with doctors on call for various procedures.There are miles of well marked walks from the village through the forests and beautiful countryside, as well as many places to visit by car within easy reach. There is a very helpful tourist office next to the hotel with loads of brochures etc.We certainly plan to return and will watch out for their special offers which are very good value."
1.10.2012,5,"Hotel is located in wonderful scenery. Ideal for walking, hiking, biking and above all- for resting. Swimming pools, welness, bathtubs with water temperature between 28 and 35 C.Ideal for recovery, young couples, families.Hotel has beautiful rooms, very spacious and comfortable. Food is excellent.Highly recommended!!!"
3.08.2012,5,"Incredibly beautiful and well designed room. We felt so happy being there. The room was spacious, warm and comfortable. The staff were also very welcoming and helpful. The quality of the food was fantastic. Accommodating our vegan diet was also no big deal to them. Like, wow! I highly recommend Hotel Balnea Superior to anyone looking for a place to relax and recharge. If you appreciate eating delicious and nutritious whole foods this is absolutely the place for you!A small note: The pools temperature were a bit disappointing. I think they could be a bit hotter but maybe there's some temperature/health regulation that I don't know about? Regardless, it was still very relaxing and enjoyable to be in the pools."
28.03.2012,4,"Good, efficiently run 4 star, staff ""on the ball"" food very good, super swimming pool and fitness centre, bedroom comfortable and large clean en-suite, all in all well worth a visit!"
3.01.2012,5,"We went for a short stay (5 days) during the christmas holidays and our stay was perfect.Good food, service and everything in the hotel was really good.I strongly suggest this hotel with the pools and welness center !I'm going to plan another stay as soon as possible.The surroundings are poor but the great value is in the hotel and the services included."
13.11.2011,5,"Hotel Balnea is a very good hotel with kind staff and a perfect wellness center. It is not the easiest to reach, but once you manage you discover it was worthwhile."
2.09.2011,5,"The hotel was simply amazing, very warm and comfy.. would highly recommend it.. as well as the restaurant within the hotel - more than affordable prices for fantastic food"
25.04.2010,1,"OLOŽ OD OLOŽA...All that can you expect is unfriendliness of staff, dirty bath (jacuzzi),...I am very very disappointed...And this should be a four-star hotel... ojej"
27.10.2009,2,"We've traveled there during the fall school holidays - we wanted to have active holidays, some wellness treatments and program for children. It seemed that they were offering all that - at least while checking the hotel and facilities online and on the phone. Upon arrival there were some problems with parking, the young male receptionist was more dead than alive, wasn't offering much information and put us on the floor with rooms (as it turned out later) which had particularly soft mattresses, aparently for better sleeping. Well, it was horrible, as if we were sleeping in a channel - like falling into the mattress and it was very wobbly. It was a disaster and the next morning we asked them what was wrong with beds only to be told that the top floor rooms all have such mattresses and we were suppose to sleep great. I think they should have asked first if we were happy to sleep on such extremely soft mattresses. We had to move to another room - needles to say it wasn't as nice as the previous one but thankfully had more solid mattresses. Than the wellness - very unfriendly and impudent staff. They behaved as if we were there every day and we knew where to go and the rest. They advertised acupuncture but when asked for those treatments they weren't available as the doctor wasn't there - at least not for the duration of our stay (10 days). Of course no such information was to be found online. The pool was really crowded, impossible to swim, there was no staff at the sauna reception, so couldn't ask where was the sauna we wanted to go to (there are three different types of saunas, it looked dirty, dark and unpleasant. The fitness centre is very small and even though we were allowed to use it (it was included in the price) - that was only possible in the late afternoon or in the evening as beforehand there was some instructor and you were suppose to pay for his assistance. The promised activities for children have more or less dissapeared. There was no program available. The first one was cancelled 'cause there was not enough interest but no one has informed us about that particular activity (we spoke with two other families who also haven't had a clue and therefore couldn't register for that). The advertised cycling tracks were actually the regional roads - dangerous especially if your cycling with young children. A big no no!!!! And as for a hotel - it looks great on the pictures, not as much in reality. We were extremely dissapointed and cut our stay short. Don't bother."
18.03.2015,4,"The room with balcony was nice, modern, spacious and clean. We had half board, the food was excellent. Friendly staff. The pool area we didn't like much, too crowded, slippery floor around indoor pools."

12.12.2014,3,"We were at this hotel for a weekend, we bought a coupon by internet for a double room and breakfast. Good hotel, the personnel is careful and the hotel is clean, the rooms are large, I don't like the moquette but in the global the rooms are good. The bath is clean and large, we had the room in the side in front of the Church therefore the bells were a bit noisy. The breakfast was various and abundant"
3.12.2014,5,"Nice hotel in the centre of the city. very nice furnished with lots of wood in beautiful colour. Big and small conference room, with all equipments to have a good meeting. Catering is delicious. Food in the restorant is very good. Service is polite and fast. Good parking possibilities if you are driving. Nice view from upper floors."
21.11.2014,3,"Despite to the name, not in the hotel, that doen't have neither a spa nor a swimming-pool. They are just in the same city... Ok, I was there for business with just little free time,but half a hour of relax wouldn't have been so bad.I had an exellent room, but only because the hotel was fully booked. As an overall impression, it was nice and luxury in the 70s, but needs to be refreshed.Good and very wide breakfast, one of the best aspect of the hotel.Good point is indeed also the price."
5.09.2014,4,"Good service, very clean and comfortable rooms, nice to be awoken by the chiming of the nearby church bells. Food was very homely and always fresh and the kitchen was always ready to prepare more when needed Staff very friendly and helpful Close to the old city where you can find trendy bars and coffee shops"
21.08.2014,4,"The staff at Hotel Krka was very helpful & professional, especially concerning directions & recommendations of restaurants & other activities. Even the cleaning staff was quite friendly, always giving me a cheerful greeting when I saw them in the hall. (It's the little things I really appreciate.) Other than a lack of AC, my room was neat, clean, & quite sufficient for my needs. The hotel is located an easy 5 minute walk from the old town & the river. The restaurant served delicious food. Particularly noteworthy was the breakfast. It was buffet style but the eggs were cooked to order right before my eyes - then brought to my table by the chef who wore white gloves & bowed upon delivery! Loved it! Kind of a small scale grande olde hotel."
21.12.2013,4,"Stay here quite often always a good experience. Rooms always good and comfortable, although in some the carpets could do with being replaced. Staff very attentive and helpful. Free wifi throughout hotel. Good breakfast buffet plus eggs, omelets and pancakes cooked to order. Located opposite a small shopping center that has several bars and pizza places."
2.11.2013,4,"The bathroom was nice and towels good although very thin. Our room no. 403 was a little too small and it was hard to find a place to open a big suitcase. Finally I placed it in the corner between the wall and the bed and had to jumped over it every time. It was OK for one night but if we stayed longer it would be a problem. This hotel is better for business than leisure trips. We were happy because air condition was working very well. It was very clean, staff was kind but the best was breakfast that was really a big surprise. In addition to food that you can usually find in four star hotels there were some traditional Slovene dishes and sparkling wine.There was even a traditional cake from Prekmurje 'prekmurska gibanica' which was the best one I have ever eaten. It was much more delicious than the one I ate in a famous restaurant in Prekmurje some years ago. The breakfast was really great and we wished we had more time for it."
26.10.2013,2,"We stayed at the Terme Krka in September while touring around Slovenian for 10days. Our stay in this hotel was disappointing to say the least. Our room was tired looking and in need of some serious refurbishment. The carpet was dirty and needed to be cleaned and in the bathroom the toilet had some serious stains that looked like they needed some good elbow grease. We were travelling with another couple who were given a very large, clean room that was nowhere near as bad as our room. They were happy which was good, but our experience was not a good one and I was glad we were only staying one night. On the positive side, the food at this hotel was good. If I was travelling through Slovenia again I wouldn't stay at this hotel or in Novo Mesto. I would stay at Smarjeske Toplice or its surrounds. It seemed more appealing with a lot more good hotels to choose from. Or do a farm stay where the accommodation is clean and good value for your money."
